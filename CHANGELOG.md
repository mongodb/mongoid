## 5.0.0

### Major Changes (Backwards Incompatible)

* Mongoid now uses the official Mongo Ruby Driver 2.x instead of Moped.

* Most driver specific configuration options have changed, please see [here](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/tutorial/ruby-driver-tutorial/#ruby-options) for the new options.

* All references to `session` are now replaced with `client`. This includes the mongoid.yml configuration, `store_in` options, and all exceptions and modules with `Session` in the name.

* `find_and_modify` has been removed and replaced with 3 options: `find_one_and_update`, `find_one_and_delete` and `find_one_and_replace`.

* `text_search` has been removed as it is now a `$text` option in a query from 2.6 on.

* Mongoid no longer supports MongoDB 2.2 - support is now for only 2.4 and higher.

* \#3768 `first` and `last` no longer add an `_id` sort when no sorting options have been provided. In order to guarantee that a document is the first or last, it needs to now contain an explicit sort.

* `Document#deleted?` alias has been removed, please continue to use `Document#destroyed?`.

* \#4005 Fixed inclusion of mongoid with Rails components that don't have the Rails environment.

* \#3993 Fixes issue where `dup`/`clone` fails for embedded documents that use store_as without using Mongoid::Atributes::Dynamic

* \#3991 Fixed emebdded documents not flagging as changed after calling #changed? and modifying the
child elements.

* \#3874 Adding snapshot option to context.

* \#3948 Fix remove_undefined_indexes on rails 4.2, to symbolize right the Document keys. (Adam Wróbel)

* \#3626 Document#to_key, needs to return a ObjectId as String so we can query back using that id. (Arthur Neves)

* \#3888 raise UnknownAttributeError when 'set' is called on non existing field and Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic is not included in model. (Shweta Kale)

* \#3889 'set' will allow to set value of non existing field when Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic is included in model. (Shweta Kale)

* \#3812 Fixed validation context when saving (Yaroslav Zemlyanuhin)

## 4.0.1

### Resolved Issues

* \#3911 Fix relations named "parent". (nkriege)

* \#3792/\#3881 Fix many internal calls to #_id instead of #id to avoid issues
  when overloading #id (Gauthier Delacroix)

* \#3773 Use nanoseconds for cache_key timestamp instead of plain seconds. (Máximo Mussini)

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes (Backwards Incompatible)

* \#3320 Remove Rails dependencies on database rake tasks. (Arthur Neves)

    All db:* rake tasks should work as before when using Rails.
    When not in a Rails, just load the database tasks using:

        load 'mongoid/tasks/database.rake'

* Mongoid 4 now only supports MongoDB 2.4.0 and higher.

* `Document#metadata` has been renamed to `Document#relation_metadata` to
  avoid common conflicts. Relation proxies also have this renamed to the
  same as well.

* Scopes and default scopes must now all be defined within lambdas or procs.

* `skip_version_check` config option was removed.

* IdentityMap removed. (Arthur Neves)

* Eager load rework. Eager load now doesnt need the identity map to load
  related documents. A set of preloaders can eager load the associations
  passed to .includes method. (Arthur Neves)

* Mongoid now supports the new read preferences that the core drivers
  provide. These include:

    - `:primary`: Will always read from a primary node. (default)
    - `:primary_preferred`: Attempt a primary first, then secondary if none available.
    - `:secondary`: Will always read from a secondary node.
    - `:secondary_preferred`: Attempt a secondary first, then primary if none available.
    - `:nearest`: Attempt to read from the node with the lowest latency.

    Sample syntax:

        Person.with(read: :secondary).first

    The `:consistency` option is no longer valid, use the `:read` option now.

* Mongoid now defaults all writes to propagate (formerly "safe mode") and now
  has different propagate semantics:

    - `{ w: -1 }`: Don't verify writes and raise no network errors.
    - `{ w: 0 }`: Don't verify writes and raise network errors.
    - `{ w: 1 }`: Verify writes on the primary node. (default)
    - `{ w: n }`: Verify writes on n number of nodes.
    - `{ w: "majority" }`: Verify writes on a majority of nodes.

    Sample syntax:

        Person.with(write: {w: :majority}).create!(name: "John")

    The `:safe` option is no longer valid use the `:write` option now.

* \#3230 Array and Hash fields now validate that the correct types are
  getting set, instead of allowing any value. (Rodrigo Saito)

* \#3043/\#2949 Rework on the internals of persistence options. (Arthur Neves)

* Mongoid now requires Active Model 4 or higher.

* `Document#set` now accepts multiple attributes in the form of a hash,
  instead of the previous `(field, value)` args. Field aliases and typecasting
  are also now supported in this operation.

        document.set(name: "Photek", likes: 10000)

* `Document#rename` now accepts multiple attributes in the form of a hash,
  instead of the previous `(field, value)` args. Field aliases are supported.

        document.rename(first_name: "fn", last_name: "ln")

* `Document#inc` now accepts multiple attributes in the form of a hash, instead
  of previously only being able to increment one value at a time. Aliases and
  serialization is supported.

        document.inc(score: 10, place: -1, lives: -10)

* `Document#pop` now accepts multiple attributes in the form of a hash, instead
  of previously only being able to pop one value at a time. Aliases and
  serialization is supported.

        document.pop(names: 1, aliases: -1)

* `Document#bit` now accepts multiple attributes in the form of a hash, instead
  of previously only being able to apply one set of operations at a time.
  Aliases and serialization are supported.

        document.bit(age: { and: 13 }, score: { or: 13 })

* `Document#pull` now accepts multiple attributes in the form of a hash, instead
  of previously only being able to pull one value at a time. Aliases and
  serialization is supported.

        document.pull(names: "James", aliases: "007")

* `Document#pull_all` now accepts multiple attributes in the form of a hash,
  instead of previously only being able to pull one value at a time. Aliases and
  serialization is supported.

        document.pull_all(names: ["James", "Bond"], aliases: ["007"])

* `Document#push_all` has been removed since it was deprecated in MongoDB 2.4.
  Use `Document.push` instead.

* `Document#push` now accepts multiple attributes in the form of a hash, and
  can handle the pushing of single values or multiple values to the field via
  $push with $each. Aliases and serialization is supported.

        document.push(names: "James", aliases: [ "007", "Jim" ])

* `Document#add_to_set` now accepts multiple attributes in the form of a hash,
  and now aliases and serialization are supported.

        document.add_to_set(names: "James", aliases: "007")

* Criteria atomic operations API is now changed to match the changes in the
  single document atomic API, for example:

        Band.where(name: "Depeche Mode").inc(likes: 10, followers: 20)

* \#3399 #create and #create! on relations can now take an array of attributes as
  the first parameter to create multiple documents at once.

        person.addresses.create([{ street: "Bond" }, { street: "Upper" }])
        person.addresses.create!([{ street: "Bond" }, { street: "Upper" }])

* \#3141 `rake db:test:prepare` now sets up all defined indexes if Mongoid is the
  only ODM/ORM in the environment.

* \#3138 `update_attributes` can now be accessed simply by calling `update`.

* \#3083 A new rake task: `rake db:mongoid:remove_undefined_indexes` has been added to
  remove indexes from the database that are not explicitly defined in the models.
  (Aidan Feldman)

* \#3029 The `relation_field` field that is added for a single use case with polymorphic
  relations has been removed. So where the following would work before:

        class Eye
          include Mongoid::Document
          belongs_to :eyeable, polymorphic: true
        end

        class Face
          include Mongoid::Document
          has_one :left_eye, class_name: "Eye", as: :eyeable
          has_one :right_eye, class_name: "Eye", as: :eyeable
        end

      This would now need to be modeled as (with the appropriate migration):

        class Eye
          include Mongoid::Document
          belongs_to :left_socket, class_name: "Face", inverse_of: :left_eye
          belongs_to :right_socket, class_name: "Face", inverse_of: :right_eye
        end

        class Face
          include Mongoid::Document
          has_one :left_eye, class_name: "Eye", inverse_of: :left_socket
          has_one :right_eye, class_name: "Eye", inverse_of: :right_socket
        end

* \#3075 `update_attribute` now properly calls the setter method instead of
  using `write_attribute`.

* \#3060 Allow atomically blocks to allow multiple calls of the same type.
  (Brian Norton)

* \#3037 Model indexes are no longer stored in an `index_options` hash on the
  model class. Instead, an array named `index_specifications` now exists on the
  class which contains a list of `Indexable::Specification` objects. This is so
  we could properly handle the case of indexes with the same keys but different
  order.

* \#2956 Caching on queries now only happens when `cache` is specifically
  called. (Arthur Neves)

* \#2659 `Mongoid::Railtie` now properly uses only one initializer and
  the name has changed to `mongoid.load-config`.

* \#2656 `rake db:reseed` is now `rake db:reset` (Arthur Neves)

* \#2648 `Boolean` becomes `Mongoid::Boolean` to avoid polluting the global
  namespace with a commonly used class by other libraries.

* \#2603 Return values from setters are now always the set value, regardless
  of calling the setter or using send.

* \#2597 `Mongoid::Observer` was removed in line with Rails 4.

* \#2563 The `allow_dynamic_fields` configuration option has been removed as
  dynamic fields are now allowed on a per-model level. In order to allow a
  model to use dynamic fields, simply include the module in each.
  (Josh Martin)

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document
          include Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic
        end

* \#2497 Calling `to_json` no longer tampers with the return value from the
  driver, and proper returns `{ "$oid" : object_id.to_s }` instead of just
  the string representation previously.

* \#2433 `Mongoid::Paranoia` has been removed.

* \#2432 `Mongoid::Versioning` has been removed.

* \#2218 Creating or instantiating documents that have default scopes will now
  apply the default scope to the document, if the scope is not complex.

* \#2200 Mass assignment security now mirrors Rails 4's behavior.
  `without_protection` option was also removed.
  `attr_accessible` class method was removed.
  Mongoid and Strong parameters should work fine for mass assignment protection.

* `delete_all` and `destroy_all` no longer take a `:conditions` hash but
  just the raw attributes.

* \#1908 Documents now loaded from criteria using `#only` or `#without` will now
  raise an error when attempting to save, update, or delete these records.
  Additionally fields excluded from the fields retrieved from the database will
  also raise an exception when trying to access them.

* \#1344 Atomic updates can now be executed in an `atomically` block, which will
  delay any atomic updates on the document the block was called on until the
  block is complete.

    Update calls can be executed as normal in the block:

        document.atomically do
          document.inc(likes: 10)
          document.bit(members: { and: 10 })
          document.set(name: "Photek")
        end

    The document is also yielded to the block:

        document.atomically do |doc|
          doc.inc(likes: 10)
          doc.bit(members: { and: 10 })
          doc.set(name: "Photek")
        end

    The atomic commands are have a fluid interface:

        document.atomically do |doc|
          doc.inc(likes: 10).bit(members: { and: 10 }).set(name: "Photek")
        end

    If the fluid interface is leveraged without the `atomically` block, the
    operations will persist in individual calls. For example, the following
    would hit the database 3 times without the block provided:

        doc.inc(likes: 10).bit(members: { and: 10 }).set(name: "Photek")

    The block is only good for 1 document at a time, so embedded and root
    document updates cannot be mixed at this time.

### New Features

* Mongoid now uses ActiveSupport::LogSubscriber to subscribe logs, and
  ActiveSupport::Notifications to send operation logs. (Arthur Neves)
  Example of log subscription:

    ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe('query.moped') do |event|
      ..
    end

* Field types can now use symbols as well as class names. See:
  https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid/blob/master/lib/mongoid/fields.rb#L16
  for the available mappings.

* \#3580 Fields can now be reset to their default values, with the methods:

    document.reset_name_to_default!

* \#3513 Documents now have a `#destroy!` method that will raise a
  `Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotDestroyed` error if a destroy callback returns
  a false value.

* \#3496 Added class level and criteria level `find_or_create_by!`.

* \#3479 Map/reduce now respects criteria no timeout options if output is not
  inline.

* \#3478 Criteria objects now have a #none method that will cause the criteria to
  never hit the database and always have zero documents.

    Band.none
    Band.none.where(name: "Tool") # Always has zero documents.

* \#3410 Mongoid now has a query cache that can be used as a middleware in
  Rack applications. (Arthur Neves)

    For Rails:

      config.middleware.use(Mongoid::QueryCache::Middleware)

* \#3319 Counters can now be reset from a document instance:

    document.reset_counters(:relation)

* \#3310 embedded_in relations now accept a `touch` option to update parents.

* \#3302 Aliasing using `alias_attribute` now properly handles aliases in criteria.

* \#3155 Range field will persist the exclude_end when provided.
  (Daniel Libanori)

* \#3146 Adding :overwrite field option, when it`s true, it wont check duplicates.
 (Daniel Libanori)

* \#3002 Reloading the Rails console will also now clear Mongoid's identity map.

* \#2938 A configuration option `duplicate_fields_exception` has been added that
  when set to `true` will raise an exception when defining a field that will
  override an existing method. (Arthur Neves)

* \#2924 MongoDB 2.4 beta text search now has a DSL provided by Mongoid. Like
  other queries, text searches are lazy evaluated, and available off the class
  or criteria level.

    Note that any 3rd party gem that provides a `text_search` method will now no
    longer work with Mongoid, and will need to change its syntax. Examples:

        Band.text_search("mode").project(name: 1).each do |doc|
          # ...
        end

        Band.limit(10).text_search("phase").language("latin")
        Band.where(:likes.gt => 1000).text_search("lucy")

* \#2855 Multiple extensions can now be supplied to relations. (Daniel Libanori)

* \#3089 Allow demongoization of strings to floats (Daniel Libanori)

* \#3278 Counter cache should update the document in memory too. (Arthur Neves)

* \#3242 Has_many relation must use the inverse foreign_key. (Arthur Neves)

* \#3233 Don't double call validation callbacks when cascading children and
  relation validation is turned on.

* \#3197 Improvements in the calls to `aggregates` on root and embedded
  collections. (Wojciech Piekutowski)

* \#3144/\#3219 Fixing name colission on @_children ivar. (Arthur Neves)

* \#3088 Range field can accept a hash, which could be the attribute from the db.
  (Daniel Libanori)

  of the numericality validator. (Lailson Bandeira)

* \#2838 `store_in` options now properly merge instead of override.
  (Colin MacKenzie)

## 3.1.0

  depend on the aggregation framework.

* The minimum Active Model and Active Support dependencies have been
  raised to 3.2.

* \#2809 Relations can now specify a primary key to use instead of the
  id on foreign keys.

        class Person
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :username, type: String
          has_many :cats, primary_key: "username"
        end

        class Cat
          include Mongoid::Document
          belongs_to :person, primary_key: "username"
        end

* \#2804 $geoNear support has now been added to criteria.

        Bar.where(:likes.gt => 1000).geo_near([ 52, 13 ])
        Bar.geo_near([ 52, 13 ]).max_distance(0.5).spherical

* \#2799 Criteria#map can now accept a symbol of a field name as well as
  a block to perform a more optimized `map`. (Gosha Arinich)

        Band.where(:likes.gt => 1000).map(:name)

* \#2798 Aggregations (`sum`, `min`, `max`, `avg`) now use the
  aggregation framework instead of map/reduce. (Gosha Arinich)

* \#2776 MongoDB 2.4.x new index types are now supported: "2dsphere",
  "text", and "hashed". (Irakli Janiashvili)

* \#2767 $maxScan support from Origin is now supported. (Jonathan Hyman)

* \#2701 Cleanup up extra excessive database queries with 1-1 relations.

* \#2693 Custom collection names can be passed to the model generator.
  (Subhash Bhushan)

        rails g model band --collection=artists

* \#2688 `Model.create` and `Model.create!` now can take an array of
  attributes hashes to create multiple documents at once. If an array
  of attributes is provided then an array of documents is returned.

        Band.create([{ name: "Tool" }, { name: "Placebo" }])
        Band.create!([{ name: "Tool" }, { name: "Placebo" }])

* \#2670 Unsetting fields now accepts multiple fields instead of only 1.
  (Arthur Neves)

        band.unset(:name, :founded)
        Band.where(name: "Placebo").unset(:members, :origin)

          belongs_to :label, counter_cache: "b_count"
        end

        class Album
          include Mongoid::Document
          belongs_to :band, counter_cache: true
        end

* \#2662 Embedded documents that have `belongs_to` relations may now
  eager load them.

* \#2657 Logger getter and setter convenience methods have been
  added to the `Config` module. (Arthur Neves)

* \#2615 Index options can now take a specific database name if the
  indexes are only to exist in a database other than the default.

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document
          index name: 1, { database: "another_db" }
        end

* \#2613 Procs can now be provided as values to `store_in`:

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document
          store_in database: ->{ Thread.current[:database] }
        end

* \#2609 Pass through batch_size option to query. (Martin Mauch)

* \#2555 Passing hashes to `find` when the documents id is of type hash

* \#2539 `Mongoid.models` now tracks all models in the application for more
  accurate determination of models for things such as indexing rake tasks.
  (Ara Howard)

* \#2525 Added the ability to have short timestamped fields with aliases. This
  sets timestamp fields as `c_at` and `u_at` that are also aliased as
  `created_at` and `updated_at` for convenience. (Rodrigo Saito)

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document
          include Mongoid::Timestamps::Short # For c_at and u_at.
        end

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document
          include Mongoid::Timestamps::Created::Short # For c_at only.
        end

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document
          include Mongoid::Timestamps::Updated::Short # For u_at only.
        end

* \#2465 Documents now have an `attribute_before_type_cast` for proper
  handling of validations. (Gerad Suyderhoud)

* \#2443 `expire_after_seconds` is now a valid index option
  (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/indexes/#ttl-indexes,
   http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/expire-data/).

        class Event
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :created_at, type: DateTime
          index({ created_at: 1 }, { expire_after_seconds: 3600 })
        end

* \#2373 Relations with the `touch: true` option will now be automatically
  touched when the child document is created or destroyed.

* Added `Document.first_or_create!` and `Criteria#first_or_create!`. This
  raises a validations error if creation fails validation.

        Band.where(name: "Depeche Mode").first_or_create!
        Band.where(name: "Tool").first_or_create!(active: true)

* Added `Document.first_or_initialize` and `Criteria#first_or_initialize`.
  This is the same as `first_or_create` but initializes a new (unpersisted)
  document if none is found.

        Band.where(name: "Depeche Mode").first_or_initialize
        Band.where(name: "Tool").first_or_initialize(active: true)

* Added `Model.pluck` and `Criteria#pluck` similar to Active Record's, which
  returns an array of values for the provided field. (Jason Lee)

        Band.where(name: "Depeche Mode").pluck(:_id)
        Band.where(name: "Tool").pluck(:likes)

* \#2324 Embeds many relations now properly handle `delete_if`.

* \#2317 Added `Document.first_or_create` and `Criteria#first_or_create`.
  This will return the first matching document or create one with additional
  attributes if one does not exist. (incorvia)

        Band.where(name: "Depeche Mode").first_or_create
        Band.where(name: "Tool").first_or_create(active: true)

* \#2292 Added `Model.each_with_index`.

* \#2285 `Config.load_configuration` is now public for those who want to instantiate
  settings directly from a hash.

* \#2275 Added rake task `db:mongoid:purge` that will drop all collections with
  the exception of the system collections in the default database.

* \#2257 `after_find` callbacks have been added for when documents are returned
  from the database.

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document

          after_find do |doc|
            # Some logic here.
          end
        end

* \#2223 Allow to find documents by javascript with parameters that are
  protected from javascript injection via `Model.for_js`.

        Band.for_js("this.name = param", param: "Tool")
        Band.where(:likes.gt => 1000).for_js("this.likes < this.follows")

* \#2197 When providing session configuration with no ports, Mongoid will now
  default these to 27017.

* \#2180 1-n and n-n relations now support before/after add/remove callbacks.
  (Rodrigo Saito)

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document

          embeds_many :albums, after_add: :notify_labels
          has_many :followers, before_remove: ->(band, follower){ notify_unfollow(follower) }
        end

* \#2157 `Criteria#update` and `Criteria#update_all` now serialize values
  according to their field type, if a field is defined.

* \#2022 Custom callbacks can now register themselves for use with observers
  by using the `observable` macro.

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document

          define_model_callbacks :notification
          observable :notification
        end

        class BandObserver < Mongoid::Observer

          def before_notification(band)
            #...
          end

          def after_notification(band)
            #...
          end
        end

* \#1766 Many to many relations will not touch the database if the foreign key
  is an empty array.

* \#1564 Many to many foreign keys now have the default set lazily only if the
  relation has been accessed. This avoids storing empty arrays if the relation
  has not been touched.

### Resolved Issues

  (Arthur Neves)

* \#2719 `distinct` is now available at the class level.

        Band.distinct(:name)

  inverse relation on `<<` or `push` if the document is already persisted.

* \#2705 Fixed logic around when children can be added to the cascading
  callbacks list.

## 3.0.19

### Resolved Issues

* Released to revert the changes in \#2703.

## 3.0.18

### Resolved Issues

  overridden and called the setter from that method.

* \#2554 Ensure `unscoped` on an `embeds_many` does not include documents
  flagged for destruction.

* \#2493 Use `Class#name` instead of `Class#model_name` when setting
  polymorphic types in case `model_name` has been overridden.

* \#2491 Removed unnecessary merge call in cascadable children.

* \#2485 Removing indexes now always uses strong consistency.

* \#2483 Versioning now handles localized fields. (Lawrence Curtis)

  gracefully.

* \#2474 Correctly detach 1-1 relations when the child is not yet loaded.
  (Kostyantyn Stepanyuk)

  longer become immediately removed from the relation in case the parent
  validation fails. Instead, they get flagged for destruction and then the
  removal occurs upon the parent passing validation and going to persist.

  the previous behavior was incorrect and did not match AR this was able
  to go into a point release.

  string is invalid. (Campbell Allen)

* \#2346 Ensure `belongs_to` relations are evolvable when passed the proxy and
  not the document.

* \#2334 Fixed aggregation map/reduce when fields sometimes do not exist.
  (James McKinney)

* \#2330 Fixed inconsistency of #size and #length on criteria when the documents
  have been iterated over with a limit applied.

* \#2328 Ensure ordering is applied on all relation criteria if defined.

* \#2327 Don't execute callbacks from base document if the document cannot execute
  them.

* \#2318 Ensure setting any numeric on a Float field actually sets it as a float,
  even if the number provided is an integer.

## 3.0.5

### Resolved Issues

* \#2313 Fixed deserialization of `nil` `TimeWithZone` fields. (nagachika)

* \#2311 `Document#changes` no longer returns `nil` values for Array and Hash
  fields that were only accessed and didn't actually change. Regression from 2.4.x.

* \#2310 Setting a many to many duplicate successively in memory no longer clears
  the inverse foreign keys.

* \#2309 Allow embeds_one relations to be set with hashes more than just the
  initial set.

* \#2308 Ensure documents retrieved via `#find` on `has_many` and
  `has_and_belongs_to_many` relations are kept in memory.

* \#2304 Default scopes now properly merge instead of overwrite when more
  than one is defined as per expectations with AR.  (Kirill Maksimov)

* \#2300 Ensure reloading refreshes the document in the identity map.

* \#2298 Protect against many to many relations pulling a null set of ids.
   (Jonathan Hyman)

* \#2291 Fixed touch operations only to update the timestamp and the optional
  field, no matter what the other changes on the document are.

* \#1091 Allow presence validation to pass if the value is `false`.

## 3.0.4

### Resolved Issues

* \#2280 Fix synchronization of many-to-many relations when an ordering default
  scope exists on either side of the association.

* \#2278 `Criteria#update` now properly updates only the first matching document,
  where `Criteria#update_all` will update all matching documents. (no flag vs multi).

* \#2274 When loading models, warn if error is raised but continue processing.

* \#2272 Don't wipe selectors or options when removing the default scope for
  actual nil values. Must check if key exists as well.

* \#2266 Restored paranoid documents are no longer flagged as destroyed.
  (Mario Uher)

* \#2263 Ensure casting of non object id foreign keys on many to many relations
  happens in the initial set, not at validation time.

## 3.0.3

### Resolved Issues

* \#2259 Ensure subclassed documents can not be pulled from the identity map
  via an id of another document in the same collection with a parent or
  sibeling type.

* \#2254 $inc operations no longer convert all values to floats.

* \#2252 Don't fire autosave when before callbacks have terminated.

* \#2248 Improved the performance of `exists?` on criteria and relations.
  (Jonathan Hyman)

## 3.0.2

### Resolved Issues

* \#2244 Get rid of id mass assignment warnings in nested attributes.

* \#2242 Fix eager loading not to load all documents when calling first or
  last.

* \#2241 Map/reduce operations now always use strong consistency since they
  have the potential to write to collections, most of the time.

* \#2238 Ensure n-n foreign key fields are flagged as resizable to prevent
  `nil` -> `[]` changes when using `#only` and updating.

* \#2236 Keep the instance of the document in the validations exception
  accessible via `document` or `record`.

* \#2234 Ensure validations when document is getting persisted with custom
  options work properly with custom options, and do not clear them out if
  validation passes.

* \#2224 `Model#inc` now accepts `BigDecimal` values.

* \#2216 Fixed assignment of metadata on embeds one relations when setting
  multiple times in a row.

* \#2212 Ensure errors are cleared after a save with `validate: false` in all
  situations.

* \#2207 When eager loading ids the query must be duped to avoid multiple
  iteration problems not getting the required fields.

* \#2204 Raise an `InvalidIncludes` error when passing arguments to
  `Criteria.includes` that are invalid (not relations, or more than 1 level.)

* \#2203 Map/Reduce now works properly in conjunction with `Model#with`.

        Band.
          with(session: "secondary").
          where(:likes.gt => 100).
          map_reduce(map, reduce).
          out(inline: 1)

* \#2199 Autosave false is now respected when automatically adding
  presence validation. (John Nishinaga)

## 3.0.1

### Resolved Issues

* \#2191 Ensure proper visibility (private) for error message generation
  methods.

* \#2187 Ensure all levels of nested documents are serialized in json.

* \#2184 Allow names of relations that conflict with ruby core kernel
  methods to pass existence checks.

* \#2181 Ensure `.first` criteria sort by ascending ids, if no other
  sorting criteria was provided.

## 3.0.0

### New Features

* \#2151 When asking for metadata before persistence, Mongoid will now
  raise a `Mongoid::Errors::NoMetadata` error if the metadata is not
  present.

* \#2147 `Model#becomes` now copies over the embedded documents.

* A new callback has been introduced: `upsert`, which runs when calling
  `document.upsert` since Mongoid does not know if the document is to be
  treated as new or persisted. With this come the model callbacks:

        before_upsert
        after_upsert
        around_upsert

* \#2080/\#2087 The database or session that Mongoid persists to can now be
  overridden on a global level for cases where `Model#with` is not a viable
  option.

        Mongoid.override_database(:secondary)
        Mongoid.override_session(:secondary)

        Band.create(name: "Placebo") #=> Persists to secondary.
        band.albums.create #=> Persists to secondary.

    Note that this option is global and overrides for all models on the current
    thread. It is the developer's responsibility to remember to set this back
    to nil if you no longer want the override to happen.

        Mongoid.override_database(nil)
        Mongoid.override_session(nil)

* \#1989 Criteria `count`, `size` and `length` now behave as Active Record
  with regards to database access.

    `Criteria#count` will always hit the database to get the count.

    `Criteria#length` and `Criteria#size` will hit the database once if the
    criteria has not been loaded, and subsequent calls will return the
    cached value.

    If the criteria has been iterated over or loaded, `length` and `size`
    will never hit the db.

* \#1976 Eager loading no longer produces queries when the base query returns
  zero results.

* `Model.find_by` now accepts a block and will yield to the found document if
  it is not nil.

        Band.find_by(name: "Depeche Mode") do |band|
          band.likes = 100
        end

* \#1958/\#1798 Documents and `belongs_to` relations now support touch.

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document
          include Mongoid::Timestamps::Updated
          belongs_to :label, touch: true
        end

    Update the document's updated_at timestamp to the current time. This
    will also update any touchable relation's timestamp as well.

        Band.first.touch

    Update a specific time field along with the udpated_at.

        Band.first.touch(:founded)

    This fires no validations or callbacks.

* Mongoid now supports MongoDB's $findAndModify command.

        Band.find_and_modify("$inc" => { likes: 1 })

        Band.desc(:name).only(:name).find_and_modify(
          { "$inc" => { likes: 1 }}, new: true
        )

* \#1906 Mongoid will retrieve documents from the identity map when
  providing multiple ids to find. (Hans Hasselberg)

* \#1903 Mongoid raises an error if provided a javascript expression
  to a where clause on an embedded collection. (Sebastien Azimi)

* Aggregations now adhere to both a Mongoid API and their enumerable
  counterparts where applicable.

        Band.min(:likes)
        Band.min do |a, b|
          a.likes <=> b.likes
        end

        Band.max(:likes)
        Band.max do |a, b|
          a.likes <=> b.likes
        end

    Note that when providing a field name and no block, a single numeric
    value will be returned, but when providing a block, a document will
    be returned which has the min/max value. This is since Ruby's
    Enumerable API dictates when providing a block, the matching element
    is returned.

    When providing a block, all documents will be loaded into memory.
    When providing a symbol, the execution is handled via map/reduce on
    the server.

* A kitchen sink aggregation method is now provided, to get everything in
  in a single call for a field.

        Band.aggregates(:likes)
        # =>
        #   {
        #     "count" => 2.0,
        #     "max" => 1000.0,
        #     "min" => 500.0,
        #     "sum" => 1500.0,
        #     "avg" => 750.0
        #   }

* A DSL off the criteria API is now provided for map/reduce operations
  as a convenience.

        Band.where(name: "Tool").map_reduce(map, reduce).out(inline: 1)
        Band.map_reduce(map, reduce).out(replace: "coll-name")
        Band.map_reduce(map, reduce).out(inline: 1).finalize(finalize)

* Mongoid now uses Origin for its Criteria API. See the Origin repo
  and API docs for the documentation.

* \#1861 Mongoid now raises an `AmbiguousRelationship` error when it
  cannot determine the inverse of a relation and there are multiple
  potential candidates. (Hans Hasselberg)

* You can now perform an explain directly from criteria.

        Band.where(name: "Depeche Mode").explain

* \#1856 Push on one to many relations can now be chained.

        band.albums.push(undertow).push(aenima)

* \#1842 MultiParameterAttributes now supported aliased fields.
  (Anton Orel)

* \#1833 If an embedded document is attempted to be saved with no
  parent defined, Mongoid now will raise a `Mongoid::Errors::NoParent`
  exception.

* Added an ORM-agnostic way to get the field names

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :name, type: String
        end

        Band.attribute_names

* \#1831 `find_or_create_by` on relations now takes mass assignment
  and type options. (Tatsuya Ono)

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document
          embeds_many :albums
        end

        band.albums.find_or_create_by({ name: "101" }, LP)

* \#1818 Add capability to choose the key where your `embeds_many` relation
  is stores. (Cyril Mougel)

        class User
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :name, type: String
          embeds_many :prefs, class_name: "Preference", store_as: 'my_preferences'
        end

        user.prefs.build(value: "ok")
        user.save
        # document saves in MongoDB as:
        # { "name" => "foo", "my_preferences" => [{ "value" => "ok" }]}

* \#1806 `Model.find_or_create_by` and `Model.find_or_initialize_by` can now
  take documents as paramters for belongs_to relations.

        person = Person.first
        Game.find_or_create_by(person: person)

* \#1774 Relations now have a :restrict option for dependent relations
  which will raise an error when attempting to delete a parent that
  still has children on it. (Hans Hasselberg)

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document
          has_many :albums, dependent: :restrict
        end

        band = Band.first
        band.albums << Albums.first
        band.delete # Raises DeleteRestriction error.

* \#1764 Add method to check if field differs from the default value.

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :name, type: String, default: "New"
        end

        band = Band.first
        band.name_changed_from_default?

* \#1759 Invalid fields error messages have been updated to show the
  source and location of the original method. The new message is:

        Problem:
          Defining a field named 'crazy_method' is not allowed.
        Summary:
          Defining this field would override the method 'crazy_method',
          which would cause issues with expectations around the original
          method and cause extremely hard to debug issues.
          The original method was defined in:
            Object: MyModule
            File: /path/to/my/module.rb
            Line: 8
        Resolution:
          Use Mongoid.destructive_fields to see what names are
          not allowed, and don't use these names. These include names
          that also conflict with core Ruby methods on Object, Module,
          Enumerable, or included gems that inject methods into these
          or Mongoid internals.

* \#1753/#1649 A setter and getter for has_many relations to set its
  children is now provided. (Piotr Jakubowski)

        class Album
          include Mongoid::Document
          has_many :engineers
        end

        class Engineer
          include Mongoid::Document
          belongs_to :album
        end

        album = Album.first
        engineer = Engineer.first
        album.engineer_ids = [ engineer.id ]
        album.engineer_ids # Returns the ids of the engineers.

* \#1741 Mongoid now provides a rake task to force remove indexes for
  environments where Mongoid manages the index definitions and the
  removal should be automated. (Hans Hasselberg)

        rake db:force_remove_indexes
        rake db:mongoid:force_remove_indexes

* \#1726 `Mongoid.load!` now accepts an optional second argument for the
  environment to load. This takes precedence over any environment variable
  that is set if provided.

        Mongoid.load!("/path/to/mongoid.yml", :development)

* \#1724 Mongoid now supports regex fields.

        class Rule
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :pattern, type: Regexp, default: /[^abc]/
        end

* \#1714/\#1706 Added better logging on index creation. (Hans Hasselberg)

    When an index is present on a root document model:

        Creating indexes on: Model for: name, dob.

    When an index is defined on an embedded model:

        Index ignored on: Address, please define in the root model.

    When no index is defined, nothing is logged, and if a bad index is
    defined an error is raised.

* \#1710 For cases when you don't want Mongoid to auto-protect the id
  and type attributes, you can set a configuration option to turn this
  off.

        Mongoid.protect_sensitive_fields = false

* \#1685 Belongs to relations now have build_ and create_ methods.

        class Comment
          include Mongoid::Document
          belongs_to :user
        end

        comment = Comment.new
        comment.build_user # Build a new user object
        comment.create_user # Create a new user object

* \#1684 Raise a `Mongoid::Errors::InverseNotFound` when attempting to
  set a child on a relation without the proper inverse_of definitions
  due to Mongoid not being able to determine it.

        class Lush
          include Mongoid::Document
          embeds_one :whiskey, class_name: "Drink"
        end

        class Drink
          include Mongoid::Document
          embedded_in :alcoholic, class_name: "Lush"
        end

        lush = Lush.new
        lush.whiskey = Drink.new # raises an InverseNotFound error.

* \#1680 Polymorphic relations now use `*_type` keys in lookup queries.

        class User
          include Mongoid::Document
          has_many :comments, as: :commentable
        end

        class Comment
          include Mongoid::Document
          belongs_to :commentable, polymorphic: true
        end

        user = User.find(id)
        user.comments # Uses user.id and type "User" in the query.

* \#1677 Support for parent separable polymorphic relations to the same
  parent class is now available. This only works if set from the parent
  side in order to know which relation the children belong to.
  (Douwe Maan)

        class Face
          include Mongoid::Document
          has_one :left_eye, class_name: "Eye", as: :visible
          has_one :right_eye, class_name: "Eye", as: :visible
        end

        class Eye
          include Mongoid::Document
          belongs_to :visible, polymorphic: true
        end

        face = Face.new
        right_eye = Eye.new
        left_eye = Eye.new
        face.right_eye = right_eye
        face.left_eye = left_eye
        right_eye.visible = face # Will raise an error.

* \#1650 Objects that respond to `to_criteria` can now be merged into
  existing criteria objects.

        class Filter
          def to_criteria
            # return a Criteria object.
          end
        end

        criteria = Person.where(title: "Sir")
        criteria.merge(filter)

* \#1635 All exceptions now provide more comprehensive errors, including
  the problem that occured, a detail summary of why it happened, and
  potential resolutions. Example:

        (Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound)
        Problem:
          Document not found for class Town with
          id(s) [BSON::ObjectId('4f35781b8ad54812e1000001')].
        Summary:
          When calling Town.find with an id or array of ids,
          each parameter must match a document in the database
          or this error will be raised.
        Resolution:
          Search for an id that is in the database or set the
          Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to
          false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead
          of raising this error.

* \#1616 `Model.find_by` added which takes a hash of arugments to search
  for in the database. If no single document is returned a DocumentNotFound
  error is raised. (Piotr Jakubowski)

        Band.find_by(name: "Depeche Mode")

* \#1606 Mongoid now enables autosave, like Active Record, when adding
  an accepts_nested_attributes_for to a relation.

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document
          has_many :albums
          accepts_nested_attributes_for :albums # This enables the autosave.
        end

* \#1477 Mongoid now automatically protects the id and type attributes
  from mass assignment. You can override this (not recommended) by redefining
  them as accessible.

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document
          attr_accessible :id, :_id, :_type
        end

* \#1459 The identity map can be disabled now for specific code execution
  by passing options to the unit of work.

        Mongoid.unit_of_work(disable: :all) do
          # Disables the identity map on all threads for the block.
        end

        Mongoid.unit_of_work(disable: :current) do
          # Disables the identity map on the current thread for the block.
        end

        Mongoid.unit_of_work do
          # Business as usual.
        end

* \#1355 Associations now can have safety options provided to them on single
  document persistence operations.

        band.albums.with(safe: true).push(album)
        band.albums.with(safe: true).create(name: "Smiths")

        album.with(safe: true).create_producer(name: "Flood")

* \#1348 Eager loading is now supported on many-to-many relations.

* \#1292 Remove attribute now unsets the attribute when the document is
  saved instead of setting to nil.

        band = Band.find(id)
        band.remove_attribute(:label) # Uses $unset when the document is saved.

* \#1291 Mongoid database sessions are now connected to lazily, and are
  completely thread safe. If a new thread is created, then a new database
  session will be created for it.

* \#1291 Mongoid now supports any number of database connections as defined in
  the mongoid.yml. For example you could have a local single server db, a
  multi availablity zone replica set, and a shard cluster all in the same
  application environment. Mongoid can connect to any session at any point in
  time.

* \#1291 Mongoid now allows you to persist to whatever database or collection
  you like at runtime, on a per-query or persistence operation basis by using
  `with`.

        Band.with(collection: "artists").create(name: "Depeche Mode")
        band.with(database: "secondary).save!
        Band.with(collection: "artists").where(name: "Depeche Mode")

* \#1291 You can now configure on a per-model basis where its documents are
  stored with the new and improved `store_in` macro.

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document
          store_in collection: "artists", database: "secondary", session: "replica"
        end

    This can be overridden, of course, at runtime via the `with` method.

* \#1212 Embedded documents can now be popped off a relation with persistence.

        band.albums.pop # Pop 1 document and persist the removal.
        band.albums.pop(3) # Pop 3 documents and persist the removal.

* \#1188 Relations now have existence predicates for simplified checking if the
  relation is blank or not. (Andy Morris)

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document
          embeds_many :albums
          embeds_one :label
        end

        band = Band.new
        band.albums?
        band.has_albums?
        band.label?
        band.has_label?

* \#1188 1-1 relations now have an :autobuild option to indicate if the
  relation should automatically be build with empty attributes upon access
  where the relation currently does not exist. Works on embeds_one,
  embedded_in, has_one, belongs_to. (Andy Morris)

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document
          has_one :label, autobuild: true
        end

        band = Band.new
        band.label # Returns a new label with empty attributes.

      When using existence checks, autobuilding will not execute.

        band = Band.new
        band.label? # Returns false, does not autobuild on a check.
        band.has_label? # Returns false, does not autobuild on a check.

* \#1081 Mongoid indexes both id and type as a compound index when providing
  `index: true` to a polymorphic belongs_to.

        class Comment
          include Mongoid::Document

          # Indexes commentable_id and commentable_type as a compound index.
          belongs_to :commentable, polymorphic: true, index: true
        end

* \#1053 Raise a `Mongoid::Errors::UnknownAttribute` instead of no method
  when attempting to set a field that is not defined and allow dynamic
  fields is false. (Cyril Mougel)

        Mongoid.allow_dynamic_fields = false

        class Person
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :title, type: String
        end

        Person.new.age = 50 # raises the UnknownAttribute error.

* \#772 Fields can now be flagged as readonly, which will only let their
  values be set when the document is new.

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :name, type: String
          field :genre, type: String

          attr_readonly :name, :genre
        end

      Readonly values are ignored when attempting to set them on persisted
      documents, with the exception of update_attribute and remove_attribute,
      where errors will get raised.

        band = Band.create(name: "Depeche Mode")
        band.update_attribute(:name, "Smiths") # Raises ReadonlyAttribute error.
        band.remove_attribute(:name) # Raises ReadonlyAttribute error.


### Major Changes (Backwards Incompatible)

* Polymorphic relations can not have ids other than object ids. This is
  because Mongoid cannot properly figure out in an optimized way what the
  various classes on the other side of the relation store their ids as, as
  they could potentially all be different.

  This was not allowed before, but nowhere was it explicitly stated.

* \#2039 Validating presence of a relation now checks both the relation and
  the foreign key value.

* Indexing syntax has changed. The first parameter is now a hash of
  name/direction pairs with an optional second hash parameter for
  additional options.

      Normal indexing with options, directions are either 1 or -1:

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :name, type: String

          index({ name: 1 }, { unique: true, background: true })
        end

      Geospacial indexing needs "2d" as its direction.

        class Venue
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :location, type: Array

          index location: "2d"
        end

* Custom serializable fields have revamped. Your object no longer should
  include `Mongoid::Fields::Serializable` - instead it only needs to
  implement 3 methods: `#mongoize`, `.demongoize` and `.evolve`.

      `#mongoize` is an instance method that transforms your object into
      a mongo-friendly value.

      `.demongoize` is a class method, that can take some data from mongo
      and instantiate and object of your custom type.

      `.evolve` is a class method, that can take any object, and
      transform it for use in a `Mongoid::Criteria`.

      An example of an implementation of this for `Range`:

        class Range

          def mongoize
            { "min" => first, "max" => last }
          end

          class << self

            def demongoize(object)
              Range.new(object["min"], object["max"])
            end

            def evolve(object)
              { "$gte" => object.first, "$lte" => object.last }
            end
          end
        end

* `Document#changes` is no longer a hash with indifferent access.

* `after_initialize` callbacks no longer cascade to children if the option
  is set.

* \#1865 `count` on the memory and mongo contexts now behave exactly the
  same as Ruby's `count` on enumerable, and can take an object or a block.
  This is optimized on the mongo context not to load everything in memory
  with the exception of passing a block.

        Band.where(name: "Tool").count
        Band.where(name: "Tool").count(tool) # redundant.
        Band.where(name: "Tool") do |doc|
          doc.likes > 0
        end

    Note that although the signatures are the same for both the memory and
    mongo contexts, it's recommended you only use the block syntax for the
    memory context since the embedded documents are already loaded into
    memory.

    Also note that passing a boolean to take skip and limit into account
    is no longer supported, as this is not necessarily a useful feature.

* The `autocreate_indexes` configuration option has been removed.

* `Model.defaults` no longer exists. You may get all defaults with a
  combination of `Model.pre_processed_defaults` and
  `Model.post_processed_defaults`.

        Band.pre_processed_defaults
        Band.post_processed_defaults

* `Model.identity` and `Model.key` have been removed. For custom ids,
  users must now override the _id field.

    When the default value is a proc, the default is applied *after* all
    other attributes are set.

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :_id, type: String, default: ->{ name }
        end

    To have the default applied *before* other attributes, set `:pre_processed`
    to true.

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :_id,
            type: String,
            pre_processed: true,
            default: ->{ BSON::ObjectId.new.to_s }
        end

* Custom application exceptions in various languages has been removed,
  along with the `Mongoid.add_language` feature.

* Mongoid no longer supports 1.8. MRI 1.9.3 and higher, or JRuby 1.6 and
  higher in 1.9 mode are only supported.

* \#1734 When searching for documents via `Model.find` with multiple ids,
  Mongoid will raise an error if not *all* ids are found, and tell you
  what the missing ones were. Previously the error only got raised if
  nothing was returned.

* \#1675 Adding presence validation on a relation now enables autosave.
  This is to ensure that when a new parent object is saved with a new
  child and marked is valid, both are persisted to ensure a correct
  state in the database.

* \#1491 Ensure empty translations returns an empty hash on access.

* \#1484 `Model#has_attribute?` now behaves the same as Active Record.

* \#1471 Mongoid no longer strips any level of precision off of times.

* \#1475 Active support's time zone is now used by default in time
  serialization if it is defined.

* \#1342 `Model.find` and `model.relation.find` now only take a single or
  multiple ids. The first/last/all with a conditions hash has been removed.

* \#1291 The mongoid.yml has been revamped completely, and upgrading
  existing applications will greet you with some lovely Mongoid specific
  configuration errors. You can re-generate a new mongoid.yml via the
  existing rake task, which is commented to an insane degree to help you
  with all the configuration possibilities.

* \#1291 The `persist_in_safe_mode` configuration option has been removed.
  You must now tell a database session in the mongoid.yml whether or not
  it should persist in safe mode by default.

        production:
          sessions:
            default:
              database: my_app_prod
              hosts:
                - db.app.com:27018
                - db.app.com:27019
              options:
                consistency: :eventual
                safe: true

* \#1291 `safely` and `unsafely` have been removed. Please now use `with`
  to provide safe mode options at runtime.

        Band.with(safe: true).create
        band.with(safe: { w: 3 }).save!
        Band.with(safe: false).create!

* \#1270 Relation macros have been changed to match their AR counterparts:
  only :has_one, :has_many, :has_and_belongs_to_many, and :belongs_to
  exist now.

* \#1268 `Model#new?` has been removed, developers must now always use
  `Model#new_record?`.

* \#1182 A reload is no longer required to refresh a relation after setting
  the value of the foreign key field for it. Note this behaves exactly as
  Active Record.

    If the id is set, but the document for it has not been persisted, accessing
    the relation will return empty results.

    If the id is set and its document is persisted, accessing the relation
    will return the document.

    If the id is set, but the base document is not saved afterwards, then
    reloading will return the document to its original state.

* \#1093 Field serialization strategies have changed on Array, Hash, Integer
  and Boolean to be more consistent and match AR where appropriate.

    Serialization of arrays calls `Array.wrap(object)`
    Serialization of hashes calls `Hash[object]` (to_hash on the object)
    Serialization of integers always returns an int via `to_i`
    Serialization of booleans defaults to false instead of nil.

* \#933 `:field.size` has been renamed to `:field.count` in criteria for
  $size not to conflict with Symbol's size method.

* \#829/\#797 Mongoid scoping code has been completely rewritten, and now
  matches the Active Record API. With this backwards incompatible change,
  some methods have been removed or renamed.

    Criteria#as_conditions and Criteria#fuse no longer exist.

    Criteria#merge now only accepts another object that responds to
    `to_criteria`.

    Criteria#merge! now merges in another object without creating a new
    criteria object.

        Band.where(name: "Tool").merge!(criteria)

    Named scopes and default scopes no longer take hashes as parameters.
    From now on only criteria and procs wrapping criteria will be
    accepted, and an error will be raised if the arguments are incorrect.

        class Band
          include Mongoid::Document

          default_scope ->{ where(active: true) }
          scope :inactive, where(active: false)
          scope :invalid, where: { valid: false } # This will raise an error.
        end

    The 'named_scope' macro has been removed, from now on only use 'scope'.

    Model.unscoped now accepts a block which will not allow default scoping
    to be applied for any calls inside the block.

        Band.unscoped do
          Band.scoped.where(name: "Ministry")
        end

    Model.scoped now takes options that will be set directly on the criteria
    options hash.

        Band.scoped(skip: 10, limit: 20)

* \#463 `Document#upsert` is no longer aliased to `Document#save` and now
  actually performs a proper MongoDB upsert command when called. If you
  were using this method before and want the same behavior, please switch
  to `save`.

        band = Band.new(name: "Tool")
        band.upsert #=> Inserts the document in the database.
        band.name = "Placebo"
        band.upsert #=> Updates the existing document.

  option. (Pavel Pravosud)

* \#1496 Mongoid now casts strings back to symbols for symbol fields that

* \#1454, \#900 Associations now have an `after_build` callback that gets
  executed after `.build` or `build_` methods are called.
  (Jeffrey Jones, Ryan Townsend)

* \#1451 Ranges can now be any range value, not just numbers. (aupajo)

  ability to get and set all translations at once.

* \#1362 Aliased fields now properly typecast in criteria.

* \#1337 Array fields, including HABTM many foreign keys now have smarter dirty
  checking and no longer perform a simple $set if the array has changed. If
  items have only been added to the array, it performs a $pushAll. If items
  have only been removed, it performs a $pullAll. If both additions and
  removals have occurred it performs a $set to avoid conflicting mods.

* \#1449 New documents no longer get persisted when replaced on a has one as
  a side effect. (jasonsydes)

* \#1439 embedded? should return true when relation defined as cyclic.

  hash of locale => value pairs. `field :name, localize: true`

* \#1275 For applications that default safe mode to true, you can now tell a
  single operation to persist without safe mode via #unsafely:
  `person.unsafely.save`, `Person.unsafely.create`. (Matt Sanders)

* \#1256 Mongoid now can create indexes for models in Rails engines. (Caio Filipini)

* \#1228 Allow pre formatting of compsoite keys by passing a block to #key.
  (Ben Hundley)

* \#1222 Scoped mass assignment is now supported. (Andrew Shaydurov)

* \#1103 Allow developers to create their own custom complex criteria. (Ryan Ong)

* Mongoid now includes all defined fields in `serializable_hash` and `to_json`
  results even if the fields have no values to make serialized documents easier
  to use by ActiveResource clients.

* Support for MongoDB's $and operator is now available in the form of:
  `Criteria#all_of(*args)` where args is multiple hash expressions.

* \#1250, \#1058 Embedded documents now can have their callbacks fired on a parent

  for has_many instead of just breaking the relation.

* \#1272 Don't modify configuration options in place when creating replica set
  connections.

## 2.2.0

### New Features

* Mongoid now contains eager loading in the form of `Criteria#includes(*args)`.
  This works on has_one, has_many, belongs_to associations and requires the identity map to
  be enabled in order to function. Set `identity_map_enabled: true` in your
  `mongoid.yml`. Ex: `Person.where(title: "Sir").includes(:posts, :game)`

* Relations can now take a module as a value to the `:extend` option. (Roman
  Shterenzon)

* Capped collections can be created by passing the options to the `#store_in`
  macro: `Person.store_in :people, capped: true, max: 1000000`

* Mongoid::Collection now supports `collection.find_and_modify`

* `Document#has_attribute?` now aliases to `Document#attribute_present?`

* \#930 You can now turn off the Mongoid logger via the mongoid.yml by
doing `logger: false`

* \#909 We now raise a `Mongoid::Errors::Callback` exception if persisting with
a bang method and a callback returns false, instead of the uninformative
validations error from before.

### Major Changes

* \#1173 has_many relations no longer delete all documents on a set of the relation
 (= [ doc_one, doc_two ]) but look to the dependent option to determine what
 behavior should occur. :delete and :destroy will behave as before, :nullify and
 no option specified will both nullify the old documents without deleting.

* \#1142, \#767 Embedded relations no longer immediately persist atomically
when accessed via a parent attributes set. This includes nested attributes setting
and `attributes=` or `write_attributes`. The child changes then remain dirty and
atomically update when save is called on them or the parent document.

### Resolved Issues

* \#1190 Fixed the gemspec errors due to changing README and CHANGELOG to markdown.

* \#1180, \#1084, \#955 Mongoid now checks the field types rather than if the name
contains `/id/` when trying to convert to object ids on criteria.

when calling `#first`

* \#1175 Make sure both sides of many to many relations are in sync during a create.

* \#1172 Referenced enumerable relations now properly handle `#to_json`
(Daniel Doubrovkine)

* \#1139 Enumerable targets now quack like arrays.

* \#1136 Setting `belongs_to` parent to `nil` no longer deletes the parent.

* \#1120 Don't call `in_memory` on relations if they don't respond to it.

* \#1075 Set `self` in default procs to the document instance.

* \#1072 Writing attributes for nested documents can take a hash or array of hashes.

* \#990 Embedded documents can use a single `embedded_in` with multiple parent definitions.

## 2.1.8

### Resolved Issues

### Resolved Issues

* \#1116 Embedded children retain reference to parent in destroy callbacks.

* \#1110, \#1115 Don't memoize metadata related helpers on documents.
