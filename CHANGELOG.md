# Overview

For instructions on upgrading to newer versions, visit [mongoid.org](http://mongoid.org/docs/upgrading.html).

## 2.2.0

### New Features

* Mongoid now contains eager loading in the form of `Criteria#includes(|*args)`.
  This works on all relational associations and requires the identity map to
  be enabled in order to function. Set `identity_map_enabled: true` in your
  `mongoid.yml`.

* Relations can now take a module as a value to the `:extend` option. (Roman
  Shterenzon)

* Capped collections can be created by passing the options to the `#store_in`
  macro: `Person.store_in :people, capped: true, max: 1000000`

## 2.1.3

### Resolved Issues

* \#1109 Fixed validations not loading one to ones into memory.

* \#1107 Mongoid no longer wants required `mongoid/railtie` in `application.rb`.

* \#710 Nested attributes accept both `id` and `_id` in hashes or arrays.

* \#1047 Ignore `nil` values passed to `embeds_man` pushes and substitution. (Derick Bailey)

## 2.1.1

### Resolved Issues

* \#1021, \#719 Many to many relations dont trigger extra database queries when pushing new documents.

* \#607 Calling `create` on large associations does not load the entire relation.

* \#1064 `Mongoid::Paranoia` should respect `unscoped` and `scoped`.

* \#618 Crack XML library breaks Mongoid by adding `#attributes` method to the `String` class. (Stephen McGinty)

## 2.1.0

### Major Changes

* Mongoid now requires MongoDB 1.8.x in order to properly support the `#bit` and `#rename` atomic operations.

* Traditional slave support has been removed from Mongoid. Replica sets should be used in place of traditional master and slave setups.

* Custom field serialization has changed. Please see [serializable](https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid/blob/master/lib/mongoid/fields/serializable.rb) for changes.

* The dirty attribute tracking has been switched to use ActiveModel, this brings many bug fixes and changes:

  * \#756 After callbacks and observers see what was changed instead of changes just made being in previous_changes

  * \#434 Documents now are flagged as dirty when brand new or the state on instantiation differs from the database state. This is consistent with ActiveRecord.

  * \#323 Mongoid now supports [field]_will_change! from ActiveModel::Dirty

* Mongoid model preloading in development mode now defaults to `false`.

* `:autosave => true` on relational associations now saves on update as well as create.

* Mongoid now has an identity map for simple `find_by_id` queries. See the website for documentation.

### New Features

* \#1067 Fields now accept a `:versioned` attribute to be able to disable what fields are versioned with `Mongoid::Versioning`. (Jim Benton)

* \#587 Added order preference to many and many to many associations. (Gregory Man)

* Added ability to chain `order_by` statements. (Gregory Man)

* \#961 Allow arbitrary `Mongo::Connection` options to pass through `Mongoid::Config::Database` object. (Morgan Nelson)

* Enable `autosave` for many to many references. (Dave Krupinski)

* The following explicit atomic operations have been added: `Model#bit`, `Model#pop`, `Model#pull`, `Model#push_all`, `Model#rename`, `Model#unset`.

* Added exception translations for Hindi. (Sukeerthi Adiga)

### Resolved Issues

* \#974 Fix `attribute_present?` to work correctly then attribute value is `false`, thanks to @nickhoffman. (Gregory Man)

* \#960 create indexes rake task is not recognizing a lot of mongoid models because it has problems guessing their model names from filenames. (Tobias Schlottke)

* \#874 Deleting from a M-M reference is one-sided. (nickhoffman, davekrupinski)

* Replace deprecated `class_inheritable_hash` dropped in Rails 3.1+. (Konstantin Shabanov)

* Fix inconsistent state when replacing an entire many to many relation.

* Don't clobber inheritable attributes when adding subclass field inheritance. (Dave Krupinski)

* \#914 Querying embedded documents with `$or` selector. (Max Golovnia)

* \#514 Fix marshaling of documents with relation extensions. (Chris Griego)

* `Metadata#extension` now returns a `Module`, instead of a `Proc`, when an extension is defined.

* \#837 When `allow_dynamic_fields` is set to `false` and loading an embedded document with an unrecognized field, an exception is raised.

* \#963 Initializing array of embedded documents via hash regressed (Chris Griego, Morgan Nelson)

* `Mongoid::Config.reset` resets the options to their default values.

* `Mongoid::Fields.defaults` is memoized for faster instantiation of models.
