Mongoid is an ODM (Object-Document-Mapper) framework for MongoDB in Ruby.

Project Move and Support
------------------------

For the upcoming 5.0.0 release, the repository will be getting moved to the MongoDB
organization. Please pay special attention to the following information with regards
to this move:

* 5.0.0 and higher releases of Mongoid will be officially supported by MongoDB with a dedicated team.
* Issues tagged 5.0.0 and higher in Github will be migrated to the [Mongoid Jira project](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID/) upon the release. There will be no more Github issues.
* 4.x and 3.x releases will no longer be supported. Fixes to these branches will need to be maintained in community forks, although not recommended.
* 5.0.0 release will still be supporting Rails 4.x, although there will be some backwards incompatible changes with respect to the configuration options. The Mongoid public API itself will not be changed.
