Install the Gem
===============

Mongoid is bundled as a gem, and is `hosted on Rubygems
<https://rubygems.org/gems/mongoid>`_.
It can be installed manually or with bundler.

To install the gem manually:

.. code-block:: sh

    gem install mongoid

To install the gem with bundler, include the following in your ``Gemfile``:

.. code-block:: ruby

   gem 'mongoid', '~> 9.0.0'

Using Mongoid with a New Rails Application
==========================================

When creating a new Rails application and wish to use Mongoid for
data access, give the ``--skip-active-record`` flag to the ``rails new``
command to avoid depending on and configuring ActiveRecord..

Using Mongoid with an Existing Rails Application
================================================

When converting an existing Rails application to use Mongoid for data access,
the ``config/application.rb`` file needs to be updated to remove the
``require 'rails/all'`` line and explicitly include the required frameworks
(which could be all of the frameworks provided by Rails with the exception of
ActiveRecord). Any references to ActiveRecord in files in the ``config``
directory and in the models also need to be removed.
