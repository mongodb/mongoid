Install the Gem
===============

Mongoid is bundled as a gem, and is `hosted on Rubygems
<https://rubygems.org/gems/mongoid>`_.
It can be installed manually or with bundler.

To install the gem manually:

.. code-block:: sh

    gem install mongoid

To install the gem with bundler, include the following in your ``Gemfile``:

.. code-block:: ruby

   gem 'mongoid'

Using Mongoid with a New Rails Application
==========================================

By using the `railsmdb CLI <https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid-railsmdb>`_ a new
Ruby on Rails application can be quickly generated using the same options as
``rails new``, but configured to work with MongoDB:

.. code-block:: sh

   railsmdb new my_new_rails_app

The ``rails`` CLI can also be used, however when creating a new Rails application
and where Mongoid will be used for data access, provide the ``--skip-active-record``
flag to the ``rails new`` command to avoid depending on and configuring ActiveRecord.

Additional examples can be found in the `tutorials <tutorials.html>`_.

Using Mongoid with an Existing Rails Application
================================================

Using the `railsmdb CLI <https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid-railsmdb>`_ an existing
Rails application can easily be configured for use with Mongoid:

.. code-block:: sh

   railsmdb setup

Converting an existing Rails application without using ``railsmdb`` can be done
by updating the ``config/application.rb`` file to remove the ``require 'rails/all'``
line and explicitly include the required frameworks (which could be all of the
frameworks provided by Rails with the exception ofActiveRecord).
Any references to ActiveRecord in files in the ``config`` directory and in the
models also need to be removed.
