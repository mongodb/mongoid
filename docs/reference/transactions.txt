MongoDB supports `multi-document transactions
<https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/>`_.
(Updates to multiple fields within a single document are atomic in all
versions of MongoDB). Transactions require a non-standalone MongoDB topology
and Ruby driver version 2.6 or higher. A higher level transaction API requires
Mongoid version 9.0 or higher, while a lower level API requires Mongoid
version 6.4 or higher.

Using Transactions
==================

Higher Level API
----------------

A transaction can be started by calling the ``transaction`` method on an instance
of a Mongoid document class, on a Mongoid document class, on or ``Mongoid`` module:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.transaction do
    Band.create(title: 'Led Zeppelin')
  end

  band = Band.create(title: 'Deep Purple')
  band.transaction do
    band.active = false
    band.save!
  end

  Mongoid.transaction do
    band.destroy
  end

When the ``transaction`` method is called, Mongoid does the following:

* creates a session on a client that is used by the receiver of the
  ``transaction`` method call;
* starts a transaction on the session;
* executes the given block;
* commits the transaction if no exception raised in the block;

  * calls ``after_commit`` callbacks for all objects modified inside the transaction
* aborts the transaction if an exception is raised in the block;

  * calls ``after_rollback`` callbacks for all objects modified inside the transaction
* closes the session

.. note::

  Since a transaction is tied to a particular client, _only_ operations on
  the same client will be in scope of the transaction. Therefore it
  is recommended that only objects that use the same client are used inside the
  ``transaction`` method block.

  .. code-block:: ruby

    class Author
      include Mongoid::Document
      store_in client: :encrypted_client
    end

    class User
      include Mongoid::Document
      store_in client: :encrypted_client
    end

    class Article
      include Mongoid::Document
      # This class uses the :default client
    end

    # Transaction is started on the :encrypted_client
    Author.transaction do
      # This operation uses the same client, so it is in the transaction
      Author.create!
      # This operation also uses the same client, so it is in the transaction
      User.create!
      # This operation uses a different client, so it is NOT in the transaction
      Article.create!
    end

.. note::
  When ``transaction`` method is called on ``Mongoid`` module, the transaction
  is created using the ``:default`` client.

Aborting Transaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any exception raised inside the ``transaction`` method block aborts the
transaction. Normally the raised exception passed on, except for the
``Mongoid::Errors::Rollback``. This error should be raised if you  want to
explicitly abort the transaction without passing on an exception.

Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~

Transaction API introduces two new callbacks - ``after_commit`` and ``after_rollback``.

``after_commit`` callback is triggered for an object that was created, saved,
or destroyed:

* after transaction is committed if the object was modified inside the transaction;
* after the object was persisted if the object was modified outside a transaction.

.. note::
  In any case ``after_commit`` callback is triggered only after all other callbacks
  were executed successfully. Therefore, if the object is modified without a
  transaction, it is possible that the object was persisted, but ``after_commit``
  callback was not triggered (for example, an exception raised in ``after_save``
  callback).

``after_rollback`` callback is triggered for an object that was created, saved,
or destroyed inside a transaction if the transaction was aborted. ``after_rollback``
is never triggered without a transaction.


Lower Level API
---------------

In order to start a transaction, the application must have a :ref:`session <sessions>`.

A transaction can be started by calling the ``start_transaction`` method on a session, which can be
obtained by calling the ``with_session`` method on either a model class or instance:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document
  end

  Person.with_session do |session|
    session.start_transaction
  end

  person = Person.new
  person.with_session do |session|
    session.start_transaction
  end

It is also possible to specify read concern, write concern and read preference
when starting a transaction:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Person.with_session do |session|
    session.start_transaction(
      read_concern: {level: :majority},
      write_concern: {w: 3},
      read: {mode: :primary})
  end

A transaction may be committed or aborted. The corresponding methods to do so are
``commit_transaction`` and ``abort_transaction``, again on the session instance:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Person.with_session do |session|
    session.commit_transaction
  end

  Person.with_session do |session|
    session.abort_transaction
  end

If a session ends with an open transaction,
`the transaction is aborted <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/#transactions-and-sessions>`_.

The transaction commit `can be retried <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/#retry-commit-operation>`_
if it fails. Here is the Ruby code to do so:

.. code-block:: ruby

  begin
    session.commit_transaction
  rescue Mongo::Error => e
    if e.label?(Mongo::Error::UNKNOWN_TRANSACTION_COMMIT_RESULT_LABEL)
      retry
    else
      raise
    end
  end

Note that in order to perform operations within the transaction, operations must use the same client
that the session was initiated on. By default, all operations will be done on the default client:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document
  end

  class Post
    include Mongoid::Document
  end

  Person.with_session do |s|
    s.start_transaction
    Person.create!
    Person.create!
    Post.create!
    s.commit_transaction
  end

To explicitly use a different client, use the ``with`` method:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Post.with(client: :other) do
    Person.with(client: :other) do
      Person.with_session do |s|
        s.start_transaction
        Person.create!
        Person.create!
        Post.create!
        s.commit_transaction
      end
    end
  end
