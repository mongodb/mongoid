Capped Collections
------------------

Mongoid does not provide a mechanism for creating capped collections on the fly - you
will need to create these yourself one time up front either with the driver or via the
Mongo console.

To create a capped collection with the driver, first retrieve the client:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Name
    include Mongoid::Document
  end
  client = Name.collection.client

Then create the collection:

.. code-block:: ruby

  client["names", :capped => true, :size => 1024].create

To create a capped collection from the Mongo console:

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.createCollection("name", { capped: true, size: 1024 });


Set a Default Collation on a Collection
---------------------------------------

Mongoid does not provide a mechanism for creating a collection with a default collation.
Like capped collections, you will need to create the collection yourself one time, up-front,
either with the driver or via the Mongo console.

To create a collection with a default collation with the driver:

.. code-block:: ruby

  client["name", :collation => { :locale => 'fr'}].create

To create a collection with a default collation from the Mongo console:

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.createCollection("name", { collation: { locale: 'fr' } });
