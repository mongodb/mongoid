.. _field-types:

Field Types
===========

MongoDB stores underlying document data using
`BSON types <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/bson-types/>`_, and
Mongoid converts BSON types to Ruby types at runtime in your application.
For example, a field defined with `type: :float` will use the Ruby ``Float``
class in-memory and will persist in the database as the the BSON ``double`` type.

Field type definitions determine how Mongoid behaves when constructing queries
and retrieving/writing fields from/to the database. Specifically:

1. When assigning values to fields at runtime, the values are converted to the
specified type.

2. When persisting data to MongoDB, the data is sent in an appropriate
type, permitting richer data manipulation within MongoDB or by other
tools.

3. When querying documents, query parameters are converted to the specified
type before being sent to MongoDB.

4. When retrieving documents from the database, field values are converted
to the specified type.

Changing the field definitions in a model class does not alter data already stored in
MongoDB. To update type or contents of fields of existing documents,
the field must be re-saved to the database. Note that, due to Mongoid
tracking which attributes on a model change and only saving the changed ones,
it may be necessary to explicitly write a field value when changing the
type of an existing field without changing the stored values.

Consider a simple class for modeling a person in an application. A person may
have a name, date_of_birth, and weight. We can define these attributes
on a person by using the ``field`` macro.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :name, type: String
     field :date_of_birth, type: Date
     field :weight, type: Float
   end

Below is a list of valid types for fields.

- ``Array``
- ``BigDecimal``
- ``Boolean``
- ``Date``
- ``DateTime``
- ``Float``
- ``Hash``
- ``Integer``
- ``BSON::ObjectId``
- ``BSON::Binary``
- ``Range``
- ``Regexp``
- ``Set``
- ``String``
- ``StringifiedSymbol``
- ``Symbol``
- ``Time``
- ``TimeWithZone``

To define custom field types, refer to :ref:`Custom Field Types <custom-field-types>` below.


.. _omitting-field-type-definition:

Omitting Field Type Definition
------------------------------

If you decide not to specify the type of field with the definition, Mongoid will treat
it as an object and not try to typecast it when sending the values to the database.
This can be advantageous as the lack of attempted conversion will yield a slight
performance gain. However some types are not supported if not defined as fields.
You can safely omit type specifications when:

- You're not using a web front end and values are already properly cast.
- All of your fields are strings.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :first_name
     field :middle_name
     field :last_name
   end

Types that are not supported as dynamic attributes since they cannot be cast are:

- ``BigDecimal``
- ``Date``
- ``DateTime``
- ``Range``


.. _field-type-stringified-symbol:

Field Type: StringifiedSymbol
-----------------------------

The ``StringifiedSymbol`` field type is the recommended field type for storing
values that should be exposed as symbols to Ruby applications. When using the ``Symbol`` field type,
Mongoid defaults to storing values as BSON symbols. For more information on the
BSON symbol type, see :ref:`here <field-type-symbol>`.
However, the BSON symbol type is deprecated and is difficult to work with in programming languages
without native symbol types, so the ``StringifiedSymbol`` type allows the use of symbols
while ensuring interoperability with other drivers. The ``StringifiedSymbol`` type stores all data
on the database as strings, while exposing values to the application as symbols.

An example usage is shown below:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Post
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :status, type: StringifiedSymbol
  end

  post = Post.new(status: :hello)
  # status is stored as "hello" on the database, but returned as a Symbol
  post.status
  # => :hello

  # String values can be assigned also:
  post = Post.new(status: "hello")
  # status is stored as "hello" on the database, but returned as a Symbol
  post.status
  # => :hello

All non-string values will be stringified upon being sent to the database (via ``to_s``), and
all values will be converted to symbols when returned to the application. Values that cannot be
converted directly to symbols, such as integers and arrays, will first be converted to strings and
then symbols before being returned to the application.

For example, setting an integer as ``status``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  post = Post.new(status: 42)
  post.status
  # => :"42"

If the ``StringifiedSymbol`` type is applied to a field that contains BSON symbols, the values
will be stored as strings instead of BSON symbols on the next save. This permits transparent lazy
migration from fields that currently store either strings or BSON symbols in the database to the
``StringifiedSymbol`` field type.


.. _field-type-symbol:

Field Type: Symbol
------------------

New applications should use the :ref:`StringifiedSymbol field type <field-type-stringified-symbol>`
to store Ruby symbols in the database. The ``StringifiedSymbol`` field type
provides maximum compatibility with other applications and programming languages
and has the same behavior in all circumstances.

Mongoid also provides the deprecated ``Symbol`` field type for serializing
Ruby symbols to BSON symbols. Because the BSON specification deprecated the
BSON symbol type, the `bson` gem will serialize Ruby symbols into BSON strings
when used on its own. However, in order to maintain backwards compatibility
with older datasets, the `mongo` gem overrides this behavior to serialize Ruby
symbols as BSON symbols. This is necessary to be able to specify queries for
documents which contain BSON symbols as fields.

To override the default behavior and configure the ``mongo`` gem (and thereby
Mongoid as well) to encode symbol values as strings, include the following code
snippet in your project:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Symbol
    def bson_type
      BSON::String::BSON_TYPE
    end
  end


.. _field-type-hash:

Field Type: Hash
----------------

When using a field of type Hash, be wary of adhering to the
`legal key names for mongoDB <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/limits/#naming-restrictions>`_,
or else the values will not store properly.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :first_name
     field :url, type: Hash

     # will update the fields properly and save the values
     def set_vals
       self.first_name = 'Daniel'
       self.url = {'home_page' => 'http://www.homepage.com'}
       save
     end

     # all data will fail to save due to the illegal hash key
     def set_vals_fail
       self.first_name = 'Daniel'
       self.url = {'home.page' => 'http://www.homepage.com'}
       save
     end
   end


.. _field-type-time:

Field Type: Time
----------------

``Time`` fields store values as ``Time`` instances in the :ref:`configured
time zone <time-zones>`.

``Date`` and ``DateTime`` instances are converted to ``Time`` instances upon
assignment to a ``Time`` field:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Voter
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    field :registered_at, type: Time
  end
  
  Voter.new(registered_at: Date.today)
  # => #<Voter _id: 5fdd80392c97a618f07ba344, registered_at: 2020-12-18 05:00:00 UTC>

In the above example, the value was interpreted as the beginning of today in
local time, because the application was not configured to use UTC times.


.. _field-type-date:

Field Type: Date
----------------

Mongoid allows assignment of values of several types to ``Date`` fields:

- ``Date`` - the provided date is stored as is.
- ``Time``, ``DateTime``, ``ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone`` - the date component
  of the value is taken in the value's time zone.
- ``String`` - the date specified in the string is used.
- ``Integer``, ``Float`` - the value is taken to be a UTC timestamp which is
  converted to the :ref:`configured time zone <time-zones>` (note that
  ``Mongoid.use_utc`` has no effect on this conversion), then the date is
  taken from the resulting time.

In other words, if a date is specified in the value, that date is used without
first converting the value to the configured time zone.

As a date & time to date conversion is lossy (it discards the time component),
especially if an application operates with times in different time zones it is
recommended to explicitly convert ``String``, ``Time`` and ``DateTime``
objects to ``Date`` objects before assigning the values to fields of type
``Date``.


.. _field-type-date-time:

Field Type: DateTime
---------------------

MongoDB stores all times as UTC timestamps. When assigning a value to a
``DateTime`` field, or when querying a ``DateTime`` field, Mongoid
converts the passed in value to a UTC ``Time`` before sending it to the
MongoDB server.

``Time``, ``ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone`` and ``DateTime`` objects embed
time zone information, and the value persisted is the specified moment in
time, in UTC. When the value is retrieved, the time zone in which it is
returned is defined by the :ref:`configured time zone settings <time-zones>`.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Ticket
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :opened_at, type: DateTime
   end

   Mongoid.use_activesupport_time_zone = true
   Time.zone = 'Berlin'

   ticket = Ticket.create!(opened_at: '2018-02-18 07:00:08 -0500')

    ticket.opened_at
    # => Sun, 18 Feb 2018 13:00:08 +0100
    ticket
    # => #<Ticket _id: 5c13d4b9026d7c4e7870bb2f, opened_at: 2018-02-18 12:00:08 UTC>

    Time.zone = 'America/New_York'
    ticket.opened_at
    # => Sun, 18 Feb 2018 07:00:08 -0500

    Mongoid.use_utc = true
    ticket.opened_at
    # => Sun, 18 Feb 2018 12:00:08 +0000

Mongoid also supports casting integers and floats to ``DateTime``. When
doing so, the integers/floats are assumed to be Unix timestamps (in UTC):

.. code-block:: ruby

    ticket.opened_at = 1544803974
    ticket.opened_at
    # => Fri, 14 Dec 2018 16:12:54 +0000

If a string is used as a ``DateTime`` field value, the behavior depends on
whether the string includes a time zone. If no time zone is specified,
the :ref:`default Mongoid time zone <time-zones>` is used:

.. code-block:: ruby

    Time.zone = 'America/New_York'
    ticket.opened_at = 'Mar 4, 2018 10:00:00'
    ticket.opened_at
    # => Sun, 04 Mar 2018 15:00:00 +0000

If a time zone is specified, it is respected:

.. code-block:: ruby

    ticket.opened_at = 'Mar 4, 2018 10:00:00 +01:00'
    ticket.opened_at
    # => Sun, 04 Mar 2018 09:00:00 +0000


.. _field-type-regexp:

Field Type: Regexp
------------------

MongoDB supports storing regular expressions in documents, and querying using
regular expressions. Note that MongoDB uses
`Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCRE) <http://pcre.org/>`_
and Ruby uses `Onigmo <https://github.com/k-takata/Onigmo>`_, which is a
fork of `Oniguruma regular expression engine <https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma>`_.
The two regular expression implementations generally provide equivalent
functionality but have several important syntax differences.

When a field is declared to be of type Regexp, Mongoid converts Ruby regular
expressions to BSON regular expressions and stores the result in MongoDB.
Retrieving the field from the database produces a ``BSON::Regexp::Raw``
instance:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Token
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :pattern, type: Regexp
  end

  token = Token.create!(pattern: /hello.world/m)
  token.pattern
  # => /hello.world/m

  token.reload
  token.pattern
  # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x0000555f505e4a20 @pattern="hello.world", @options="ms">

Use ``#compile`` method on ``BSON::Regexp::Raw`` to get back the Ruby regular
expression:

.. code-block:: ruby

  token.pattern.compile
  # => /hello.world/m

Note that, if the regular expression was not originally a Ruby one, calling
``#compile`` on it may produce a different regular expression. For example,
the following is a PCRE matching a string that ends in "hello":

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Regexp::Raw.new('hello$', 's')
  # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x0000555f51441640 @pattern="hello$", @options="s">

Compiling this regular expression produces a Ruby regular expression that
matches strings containing "hello" before a newline, besides strings ending in
"hello":

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Regexp::Raw.new('hello$', 's').compile =~ "hello\nworld"
  # => 0

This is because the meaning of ``$`` is different between PCRE and Ruby
regular expressions.


.. _field-default-values:

Specifying Field Default Values
-------------------------------

A field can be configured to have a default value. The default value can be
fixed, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Order
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :state, type: String, default: 'created'
  end

The default value can also be specified as a ``Proc``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Order
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :fulfill_by, type: Time, default: ->{ Time.now + 3.days }
  end

.. note::

  Default values that are not ``Proc`` instances are evaluated at class load
  time, meaning the following two definitions are not equivalent:

  .. code-block:: ruby

    field :submitted_at, type: Time, default: Time.now
    field :submitted_at, type: Time, default: ->{ Time.now }

  The second definition is most likely the desired one, which causes the
  time of submission to be set to the current time at the moment of
  document instantiation.

To set a default which depends on the document's state, use ``self``
inside the ``Proc`` instance which would evaluate to the document instance
being operated on:

.. code-block:: ruby

  field :fulfill_by, type: Time, default: ->{
    # Order should be fulfilled in 2 business hours.
    if (7..8).include?(self.submitted_at.hour)
      self.submitted_at + 4.hours
    elsif (9..3).include?(self.submitted_at.hour)
      self.submitted_at + 2.hours
    else
      (self.submitted_at + 1.day).change(hour: 11)
    end
  }

When defining a default value as a ``Proc``, Mongoid will apply the default
after all other attributes are set. To have the default be applied before
the other attributes are set, use the ``pre_processed: true`` field option:

.. code-block:: ruby

  field :fulfill_by, type: Time, default: ->{ Time.now + 3.days },
    pre_processed: true


.. _storage-field-names:

Specifying Storage Field Names
------------------------------

One of the drawbacks of having a schemaless database is that MongoDB must
store all field information along with every document, meaning that it
takes up a lot of storage space in RAM and on disk. A common pattern to limit
this is to alias fields to a small number of characters, while keeping the
domain in the application expressive. Mongoid allows you to do this and
reference the fields in the domain via their long names in getters, setters,
and criteria while performing the conversion for you.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :n, as: :name, type: String
  end

  band = Band.new(name: "Placebo")
  band.attributes # { "n" => "Placebo" }

  criteria = Band.where(name: "Placebo")
  criteria.selector # { "n" => "Placebo" }


.. _field-aliases:

Field Aliases
-------------

It is possible to define field aliases. The value will be stored in the
destination field but can be accessed from either the destination field or
from the aliased field:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    field :name, type: String
    alias_attribute :n, :name
  end
  
  band = Band.new(n: 'Astral Projection')
  # => #<Band _id: 5fc1c1ee2c97a64accbeb5e1, name: "Astral Projection">
  
  band.attributes
  # => {"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('5fc1c1ee2c97a64accbeb5e1'), "name"=>"Astral Projection"}
  
  band.n
  # => "Astral Projection"

Aliases can be removed from model classes using the ``unalias_attribute``
method.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    unalias_attribute :n
  end

.. _unalias-id:

Unaliasing ``id``
`````````````````

``unalias_attribute`` can be used to remove the predefined ``id`` alias.
This is useful for storing different values in ``id`` and ``_id`` fields:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    unalias_attribute :id
    field :id, type: String
  end
  
  Band.new(id: '42')
  # => #<Band _id: 5fc1c3f42c97a6590684046c, id: "42">


Reserved Names
--------------

Attempting to define a field on a document that conflicts with a reserved
method name in Mongoid will raise an error. The list of reserved names can
be obtained by invoking the ``Mongoid.destructive_fields`` method.


Field Redefinition
------------------

By default Mongoid allows redefining fields on a model. To raise an error
when a field is redefined, set the ``duplicate_fields_exception``
:ref:`configuration option <configuration-options>` to ``true``.

With the option set to true, the following example will raise an error:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :name

    field :name, type: String
  end

To define the field anyway, use the ``overwrite: true`` option:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :name

    field :name, type: String, overwrite: true
  end


.. _custom-id:

Custom IDs
----------

By default, Mongoid defines the ``_id`` field on documents to contain a
``BSON::ObjectId`` value which is automatically generated by Mongoid.

It is possible to replace the ``_id`` field definition to change the type
of the ``_id`` values or have different default values:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    field :_id, type: String, default: ->{ name }
  end

It is possible to omit the default entirely:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :_id, type: String
  end

If the default on ``_id`` is omitted, and no ``_id`` value is provided by
your application, Mongoid will persist the document without the ``_id``
value. In this case, if the document is a top-level document, an ``_id``
value will be assigned by the server; if the document is an embedded document,
no ``_id`` value will be assigned. Mongoid will not automatically retrieve
this value, if assigned, when the document is persisted - you
must obtain the persisted value (and the complete persisted document) using
other means:

.. code-block:: ruby

  band = Band.create!
  => #<Band _id: , >
  band.id
  => nil
  band.reload
  # raises Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound
  Band.last
  => #<Band _id: 5fc681c22c97a6791f324b99, >

Omitting ``_id`` fields is more common in :ref:`embedded documents <omit-id>`.

Mongoid also defines the ``id`` field aliased to ``_id``. The ``id``
alias can :ref:`be removed <unalias-id>` if desired (such as to integrate
with systems that use the ``id`` field to store value different from ``_id``.


.. _customizing-field-behavior:

Customizing Field Behavior
==========================

Mongoid offers several ways to customize the behavior of fields.


.. _custom-getters-and-setters:

Custom Getters And Setters
--------------------------

You may override getters and setters for fields to modify the values
when they are being accessed or written. The getters and setters use the
same name as the field. Use ``read_attribute`` and ``write_attribute``
methods inside the getters and setters to operate on the raw attribute
values.

For example, Mongoid provides the ``:default`` field option to write a
default value into the field. If you wish to have a field default value
in your application but do not wish to persist it, you can override the
getter as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class DistanceMeasurement
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    field :value, type: Float
    field :unit, type: String
    
    def unit
      read_attribute(:unit) || "m"
    end
    
    def to_s
      "#{value} #{unit}"
    end
  end
  
  measurement = DistanceMeasurement.new(value: 2)
  measurement.to_s
  # => "2.0 m"
  measurement.attributes
  # => {"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('613fa0b0a15d5d61502f3447'), "value"=>2.0}

To give another example, a field which converts empty strings to nil values
may be implemented as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class DistanceMeasurement
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    field :value, type: Float
    field :unit, type: String
    
    def unit=(value)
      if value.blank?
        value = nil
      end
      write_attribute(:unit, value)
    end
  end
  
  measurement = DistanceMeasurement.new(value: 2, unit: "")
  measurement.attributes
  # => {"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('613fa15aa15d5d617216104c'), "value"=>2.0, "unit"=>nil}


.. _custom-field-types:

Custom Field Types
------------------

You can define custom types in Mongoid and determine how they are serialized
and deserialized. In this example, we define a new field type ``Point``, which we
can use in our model class as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Profile
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :location, type: Point
  end

Then make a Ruby class to represent the type. This class must define methods
used for MongoDB serialization and deserialization as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Point

    attr_reader :x, :y

    def initialize(x, y)
      @x, @y = x, y
    end

    # Converts an object of this instance into a database friendly value.
    # In this example, we store the values in the database as array.
    def mongoize
      [ x, y ]
    end

    class << self

      # Takes any possible object and converts it to how it would be
      # stored in the database.
      def mongoize(object)
        case object
        when Point then object.mongoize
        when Hash then Point.new(object[:x], object[:y]).mongoize
        else object
        end
      end

      # Get the object as it was stored in the database, and instantiate
      # this custom class from it.
      def demongoize(object)
        Point.new(object[0], object[1])
      end

      # Converts the object that was supplied to a criteria and converts it
      # into a query-friendly form.
      def evolve(object)
        case object
        when Point then object.mongoize
        else object
        end
      end
    end
  end

The instance method ``mongoize`` takes an instance of your custom type object, and
converts it into a represenation of how it will be stored in the database, i.e. to pass
to the MongoDB Ruby driver. In our example above, we want to store our ``Point``
object as an ``Array`` in the form ``[ x, y ]``.

The class method ``mongoize`` is similar to the instance method, however it must handle
objects of all possible types as inputs. The ``mongoize`` method is used when calling the
setter methods for fields of your custom type.

.. code-block:: ruby

   point = Point.new(12, 24)
   venue = Venue.new(location: point) # This uses the Point#mongoize instance method.
   venue = Venue.new(location: [ 12, 24 ]) # This uses the Point.mongoize class method.

The class method ``demongoize`` does the inverse of ``mongoize``. It takes the raw object
from the MongoDB Ruby driver and converts it to an instance of your custom type.
In this case, the database driver returns an ``Array`` and we instantiate a ``Point`` from it.
The ``demongoize`` method is used when calling the getters of fields for your custom type.
Note that in the example above, since ``demongoize`` calls ``Point.new``, a new instance of
``Point`` will be generated on each call to the getter.

Lastly, the class method ``evolve`` is similar to ``mongoize``, however it is used
when transforming objects for use in Mongoid query criteria.

.. code-block:: ruby

   point = Point.new(12, 24)
   Venue.where(location: point) # This uses Point.evolve


.. _custom-field-options:

Custom Field Options
--------------------

You may define custom options for the ``field`` macro function
which extend its behavior at the your time model classes are loaded.

As an example, we will define a ``:required`` option which will add a presence
validator for the field. First, declare the new field option in an initializer,
specifiying its handler function as a block:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # in /config/initializers/mongoid_custom_fields.rb

  Mongoid::Fields.option :required do |model, field, value|
    model.validates_presence_of field if value
  end

Then, use it your model class:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :name, type: String, required: true
  end

Note that the handler function will be invoked whenever the option is used
in the field definition, even if the option's value is false or nil.


.. _dynamic-fields:

Dynamic Fields
==============

By default, Mongoid requires all fields that may be set on a document to
be explicitly defined using ``field`` declarations. Mongoid also supports
creating fields on the fly from an arbitrary hash or documents stored in
the database. When a model uses fields not explicitly defined, such fields
are called *dynamic fields*.

To enable dynamic fields, include ``Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic`` module
in the model:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic
  end

  bob = Person.new(name: 'Bob', age: 42)
  bob.name
  # => "Bob"

It is possible to use ``field`` declarations and dynamic fields in the same
model class. Attributes for which there is a ``field`` declaration will be
treated according to the ``field`` declaration, with remaining attributes
being treated as dynamic fields.

Attribute values in the dynamic fields must initially be set by either
passing the attribute hash to the constructor, mass assignment via
``attributes=``, mass assignment via ``[]=``, using ``write_attribute``,
or they must already be present in the database.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # OK
  bob = Person.new(name: 'Bob')

  # OK
  bob = Person.new
  bob.attributes = {age: 42}

  # OK
  bob = Person.new
  bob['age'] = 42

  # Raises NoMethodError: undefined method age=
  bob = Person.new
  bob.age = 42

  # OK
  bob = Person.new
  # OK - string access
  bob.write_attribute('age', 42)
  # OK - symbol access
  bob.write_attribute(:name, 'Bob')

  # OK, initializes attributes from whatever is in the database
  bob = Person.find('123')

If an attribute is not present in a particular model instance's attributes
hash, both the reader and the writer for the corresponding field are not
defined, and invoking them raises ``NoMethodError``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  bob = Person.new
  bob.attributes = {age: 42}

  bob.age
  # => 42

  # raises NoMethodError
  bob.name

  # raises NoMethodError
  bob.name = 'Bob'

  # OK
  bob['name'] = 'Bob'

  bob.name
  # => "Bob"

Attributes can always be read using mass attribute access or ``read_attribute``
(this applies to models not using dynamic fields as well):

.. code-block:: ruby

  bob = Person.new(age: 42)

  # OK - string access
  bob['name']
  # => nil

  # OK - symbol access
  bob[:name]
  # => nil

  # OK - string access
  bob['age']
  # => 42

  # OK - symbol access
  bob[:age]
  # => 42

  # OK
  bob.attributes['name']
  # => nil

  # OK
  bob.attributes['age']
  # => 42

  # Returns nil - keys are always strings
  bob.attributes[:age]
  # => nil

  # OK
  bob.read_attribute('name')
  # => nil

  # OK
  bob.read_attribute(:name)
  # => nil

  # OK - string access
  bob.read_attribute('age')
  # => 42

  # OK - symbol access
  bob.read_attribute(:age)
  # => 42


Special Characters in Field Names
---------------------------------

Mongoid permits dynamic field names to include spaces and punctuation:

.. code-block:: ruby

  bob = Person.new('hello world' => 'MDB')
  bob.send('hello world')
  # => "MDB"

  bob.write_attribute("hello%world", 'MDB')
  bob[:"hello%world"]
  # => "MDB"


Localized Fields
================

Mongoid supports localized fields via `i18n <https://github.com/ruby-i18n/i18n>`_.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Product
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :description, localize: true
   end

By telling the field to ``localize``, Mongoid will under the covers store the field
as a hash of locale/value pairs, but normal access to it will behave like a string.

.. code-block:: ruby

   I18n.default_locale = :en
   product = Product.new
   product.description = "Marvelous!"
   I18n.locale = :de
   product.description = "Fantastisch!"

   product.attributes
   # { "description" => { "en" => "Marvelous!", "de" => "Fantastisch!" }

You can get and set all the translations at once by using the corresponding ``_translations`` method.

.. code-block:: ruby

   product.description_translations
   # { "en" => "Marvelous!", "de" => "Fantastisch!" }
   product.description_translations =
     { "en" => "Marvelous!", "de" => "Wunderbar!" }


Fallbacks
---------

Mongoid integrates with
`i18n fallbacks <https://github.com/ruby-i18n/i18n/wiki/Fallbacks>`_.
To use the fallbacks, the respective functionality must be explicitly enabled.

In a Rails application, set the ``config.i18n.fallbacks`` configuration setting
to ``true`` in your environment and specify the fallback languages:

.. code-block:: ruby

  config.i18n.fallbacks = true
  config.after_initialize do
    I18n.fallbacks[:de] = [ :en, :es ]
  end

In a non-Rails application, include the fallbacks module into the I18n backend
you are using and specify the fallback languages:

.. code-block:: ruby

  require "i18n/backend/fallbacks"
  I18n::Backend::Simple.send(:include, I18n::Backend::Fallbacks)
  I18n.fallbacks[:de] = [ :en, :es ]

When fallbacks are enabled, if a translation is not present in the active
language, translations will be looked up in the fallback languages:

.. code-block:: ruby

  product = Product.new
  I18n.locale = :en
  product.description = "Marvelous!"
  I18n.locale = :de
  product.description # "Marvelous!"

.. note::

  In i18n 1.1, the behavior of fallbacks `changed <https://github.com/ruby-i18n/i18n/pull/415>`_
  to always require an explicit list of fallback locales rather than falling
  back to the default locale when no fallback locales have been provided.


Querying
--------

When querying for localized fields using Mongoid's criteria API, Mongoid will automatically
alter the criteria to match the current locale.

.. code-block:: ruby

   # Match all products with Marvelous as the description. Locale is en.
   Product.where(description: "Marvelous!")
   # The resulting MongoDB query filter: { "description.en" : "Marvelous!" }

Indexing
--------

If you plan to be querying extensively on localized fields, you should index each of the
locales that you plan on searching on.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Product
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :description, localize: true

     index "description.de" => 1
     index "description.en" => 1
   end


.. _read-only:

Read-Only Attributes
====================

You can tell Mongoid that certain attributes are read-only. This will allow
documents to be created with these attributes, but changes to them will be
ignored when using mass update methods such as ``update_attributes``:

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :name, type: String
     field :origin, type: String

     attr_readonly :name, :origin
   end

   band = Band.create(name: "Placebo")
   band.update_attributes(name: "Tool") # Filters out the name change.

If you explicitly try to update or remove a read-only attribute by itself,
a ``ReadonlyAttribute`` exception will be raised:

.. code-block:: ruby

   band.update_attribute(:name, "Tool") # Raises the error.
   band.remove_attribute(:name) # Raises the error.


Timestamp Fields
================

Mongoid supplies a timestamping module in ``Mongoid::Timestamps`` which
can be included to get basic behavior for ``created_at`` and
``updated_at`` fields.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     include Mongoid::Timestamps
   end

You may also choose to only have specific timestamps for creation or
modification.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     include Mongoid::Timestamps::Created
   end

   class Post
     include Mongoid::Document
     include Mongoid::Timestamps::Updated
   end

If you want to turn off timestamping for specific calls, use the timeless
method:

.. code-block:: ruby

   person.timeless.save
   Person.timeless.create!

If you'd like shorter timestamp fields with aliases on them to save space,
you can include the short versions of the modules.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     include Mongoid::Timestamps::Short # For c_at and u_at.
   end

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     include Mongoid::Timestamps::Created::Short # For c_at only.
   end

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     include Mongoid::Timestamps::Updated::Short # For u_at only.
   end


.. _field-names-with-periods-and-dollar-signs:

Field Names with Dots/Periods (``.``) and Dollar Signs (``$``)
==============================================================

MongoDB query language (MQL) generally uses the dot/period character (``.``)
to separate field names in a field path that traverses embedded documents, and
the dollar character (``$``) for operators. It is possible to utilize field
names containing the dot and dollar characters, however it is recommended to
avoid these characters for ease of querying.

MongoDB 5.0 adds `special operators
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/dot-dollar-considerations/#std-label-crud-concepts-dot-dollar-considerations>`_
for querying and modifying documents using field names containing dots and
dollars. Previous MongoDB versions do not provide a mechanism for querying
documents on fields whose names contain dots and dollars, though such documents
can be retrieved verbatim (once they are matched using some other strategy).

Mongoid provides its own DSL for querying MongoDB and, unlike MongoDB 5.0,
Mongoid does not yet provide any facilities for querying documents using
field names containing dots and dollars. It is possible to query such documents
using MQL, but not via most Mongoid DSL methods. Additionally, there is
other code in Mongoid that assumes that the dot (``.``) separates path
components which may misbehave should a document contain a field with dots
in its name.

Historically, MongoDB drivers prohibited inserting documents with field names
containing dots and dollars, since such documents couldn't be queried via
those field names. This prohibition is now being lifted due to the new
operators introduced with MongoDB 5.0; however, the required changes in the
Ruby driver `have not yet been implemented
<https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/RUBY-2528>`_. By virtue of using the Ruby
driver to interact with the database, this prohibition on inserting documents
with field names containing dots and dollars also applies to Mongoid.
Thus, while both the Ruby driver and Mongoid permit querying documents that
have been inserted using other mechanisms by field names containing dots and
dollars, there is presently no possibility to insert such documents using
either Ruby driver or Mongoid.

To summarize, field names containing dots and dollars have limited support in
Mongoid, the Ruby MongoDB driver and MongoDB server. Such field names should
only be used when interfacing with software that already uses these names,
and should be avoided for new development.
