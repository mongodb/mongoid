Document Storage
================

Mongoid by default stores documents in a collection that is the pluralized form of the class name.
For the following ``Person`` class, the collection the document would get stored in would be named ``people``.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
   end

Model class names cannot end with "s", because it will be considered as the pluralized form of
the word. For example "Status" would be considered as the plural form of "Statu",
which will cause a few known problems.

This is a limitation of the ``ActiveSupport::Inflector#classify`` which Mongoid uses to convert
from filenames and collection names to class names. You can overcome this by specifying a custom
inflection rule for your model class. For example, the following code will take care of the model
named ``Status``.

.. code-block:: ruby

   ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections do |inflect|
     inflect.singular("status", "status")
   end

The collection for the model's documents can be changed at the class level if you would like
them persisted elsewhere. You can also change the database and client the model gets persisted
in from the defaults.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     store_in collection: "citizens", database: "other", client: "analytics"
   end

The ``store_in`` macro can also take lambdas - a common case for this is multi-tenant applications.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     store_in database: ->{ Thread.current[:database] }
   end

When a document is stored in the database the ruby object will get serialized into BSON
and have a structure like so:

.. code-block:: ruby

   {
     "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9"),
     "title" : "Sir",
     "name" : {
       "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7ff"),
       "first_name" : "Durran"
     },
     "addresses" : [
       {
         "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e0"),
         "city" : "Berlin",
         "country" : "Deutschland"
       }
     ]
   }


Persistence Context Attributes
==============================

Mongoid provides ``client_name``, ``database_name`` and ``collection_name``
methods on model classes to determine the client, database and collection names
used for persistence:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.client_name
  # => :default
  
  Band.database_name
  # => "mongoid"
  
  Band.collection_name
  # => :bands


Custom
======

There may be cases where you want to persist documents to different sources from their
defaults, or with different options from the default. Mongoid provides run-time support
for this as well as support on a per-model basis.


Model-Level Persistence Options
-------------------------------

On a per-model basis, you can tell it to store in a custom collection name, a different
database, or a different client. The following example would store the Band class by
default into a collection named "artists" in the database named "music", with the client "analytics".

Note that the value supplied to the ``client`` option must be configured under ``clients``
in your mongoid.yml.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    store_in collection: "artists", database: "music", client: "analytics"
  end

If no ``store_in`` macro would have been provided, Mongoid would store the model in a
collection named "bands" in the default database in the default client.


Runtime Persistence Options
---------------------------

It is possible to change the client, database and collection, as well as
any of the MongoDB client options, used for persistence for a group of
operations by using the ``with`` method on a model class or instance:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.with(database: "music-non-stop") do |klass|
    klass.create(...)
    
    band = Band.first
    
    Band.create(...)
  end
  
  Band.with(collection: "artists") do |klass|
    klass.delete_all
    
    Band.delete_all
  end
  
  band.with(client: :tertiary) do |band_object|
    band_object.save!
    
    band.save!
  end

The ``with`` method creates a temporary persistence context and a MongoDB
client to be used for operations in the context. For the duration of the block,
the persistence context on the model class or instance that ``with`` was
called on is changed to the temporary persistence context. For convenience,
the model class or instance that ``with`` was called on is yielded to the
block.

The temporary persistence context applies to both queries and writes.

Care should be taken when performing persistence operations across different
persistence contexts. For example, if a document is saved in a temporary
persistence context, it may not exist in the default persistence context,
failing subsequent updates:

.. code-block:: ruby

  band = Band.new(name: "Scuba")
  band.with(collection: "artists") do |band_object|
    band_object.save!
  end
  
  # This will not save - updates the collection "bands" which does not have
  # the Scuba band
  band.update_attribute(likes: 1000)
  
  # This will update the document.
  band.with(collection: "artists") do |band_object|
    band_object.update_attribute(likes: 1000)
  end

As of Mongoid 6.0, the ``with`` method must always be called with a block,
and the temporary persistence context exists only for the duration of the block.
This is because a new client is created under the covers with the options
passed to ``with``. To ensure that this client is closed and its associated
resources are freed, the scope when this client could be used must be
well-defined.


Global Override
```````````````

If you want to switch the persistence context for all operations at runtime, but don't want
to be using with all over your code, Mongoid provides the ability to do this as the client
and database level globally. The methods for this are ``Mongoid.override_client`` and
``Mongoid.override_database``. A useful case for this are internationalized applications
that store information for different locales in different databases or clients, but the
schema in each remains the same.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class BandsController < ApplicationController
    before_action :switch_database
    after_action :reset_database

    private

    def switch_database
      I18n.locale = params[:locale] || I18n.default_locale
      Mongoid.override_database("my_db_name_#{I18n.locale}")
    end

    def reset_database
      Mongoid.override_database(nil)
    end
  end

In the above example, all persistence operations would be stored in the alternative
database for all remaining operations on this thread. This is why the after request
set the override back to nil - it ensures subsequent requests with no local params
use the default option.

Persistence context applies to both read and write operations. For example,
secondary reads can be performed as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.with(read: {mode: :secondary}) do
    Band.count
  end


Client and Collection Access
----------------------------

If you want to drop down to the driver level to perform operations, you can grab
the Mongo client or collection from the model or document instance:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.mongo_client
  band.mongo_client
  Band.collection
  band.collection

From here you also have the same runtime persistence options using the client's ``#with``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Band.mongo_client.with(write: { w: 0 }, database: "musik")
  client[:artists].find(...)

You can also override the :read or :write options on the collection using the collections ``#with``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  collection_w_0 = Band.collection.with(write: { w: 0 })
  collection_w_0[:artists].find(...)
