Additional Mappers
------------------

In addition to Mongoid, several other mappers are available:

- `MongoMapper <http://mongomapper.com/>`_ from John Nunemaker

- `MongoODM <https://github.com/carlosparamio/mongo_odm>`_ from Carlos Paramio

- `DriverAPILayer <http://alexeypetrushin.github.com/mongodb/driver.html>`_ from Alexey Petrushin

All the mappers build on top of the basic Ruby driver and so some
knowledge of that is useful, especially if you work with a custom
MongoDB configuration.
