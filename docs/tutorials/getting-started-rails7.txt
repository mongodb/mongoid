  This tutorial is for Ruby on Rails 7. If this is not the version you're using choose
  the appropriate tutorial for your Rails version from the navigation menu.

New Application
===============

This section demonstrates how to create a new Ruby on Rails application using the Mongoid ODM.
By replacing Rails' default `ActiveRecord <https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html>`_
adapter with MongoDB's ORM-like library for data access we will create an application similar to the
blog application described in the `Ruby on Rails Getting Started
<https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-the-blog-application>`_ guide.

The complete source code for this application can be found in the
`mongoid-demo GitHub repository
<https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid-demo/tree/master/rails>`_.

.. note::

  This guide assumes basic familiarity with Ruby on Rails.
  To learn more about Ruby on Rails, please refer to its `Getting Started
  guide <https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html>`_ or
  other Rails guides.


Install ``rails``
-----------------

We will use a Rails generator to create the application skeleton.
In order to do so, the first step is to install the ``rails`` gem:

.. code-block:: sh

    gem install rails -v '~> 7'


Create New Application
----------------------

Use the ``rails`` command to create the application skeleton, as follows:

.. code-block:: sh

    rails new blog --skip-active-record
    cd blog

We pass ``--skip-active-record`` to request that ActiveRecord is not added
as a dependency, because we will be using Mongoid instead.

Optionally Skip Tests
`````````````````````

If you intend to test your application with `RSpec <https://rspec.info/>`_, you can instruct the
generator to omit the default Rails test setup by passing ``--skip-test``
and ``--skip-system-test`` options:

.. code-block:: sh

    rails new blog --skip-bundle --skip-active-record --skip-test --skip-system-test
    cd blog

Setup Mongoid
-------------

1. Modify the ``Gemfile`` to add a reference to the
`mongoid <https://rubygems.org/gems/mongoid/>`_ gem:

.. code-block:: ruby
  :name: Gemfile
  :caption: Gemfile

    gem 'mongoid'

2. Install gem dependencies:

.. code-block:: sh

    bundle install

3. Generate the default `Mongoid configuration <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongoid/current/reference/configuration/#mongoid-configuration-options>`_:

.. code-block:: sh

    bin/rails g mongoid:config

This generator will create the ``config/mongoid.yml`` configuration file,
which is used to configure the connection to the MongoDB deployment.
Note that as we are not using ActiveRecord we will not have a ``database.yml``
file.

Configure for Self Managed MongoDB
``````````````````````````````````

The configuration created in the previous step is suitable when
a MongoDB server is running locally. If you do not already have a
local MongoDB server, `download and install MongoDB
<https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/>`_.

While the generated ``mongoid.yml`` will work without modifications,
we recommend reducing the server selection timeout for development.
With this change, the uncommented lines of ``mongoid.yml`` should look
like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    development:
      clients:
        default:
          database: blog_development
          hosts:
            - localhost:27017
          options:
            server_selection_timeout: 1


Configure for MongoDB Atlas
```````````````````````````

Instead of downloading, installing and running MongoDB locally, you can create
a free MongoDB Atlas account and create a `free MongoDB cluster in Atlas
<https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/atlas-free-tier-setup/>`_.
Once the cluster is created, follow the instructions in `connect to the cluster
page <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/connect-to-cluster/#connect-to-a-cluster>`_
to obtain the URI. Use the *Ruby driver 2.5 or later* format.

Paste the URI into the ``config/mongoid.yml`` file, and comment out the
hosts that are defined. We recommend setting the server selection timeout to 5
seconds for development environment when using Atlas.

The uncommented contents of ``config/mongoid.yml`` should look like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    development:
      clients:
        default:
          uri: mongodb+srv://user:pass@yourcluster.mongodb.net/blog_development?retryWrites=true&w=majority
          options:
            server_selection_timeout: 5

Run Application
---------------

You can now start the application server by running:

.. code-block:: sh

    bin/rails s

Access the application by navigating to `localhost:3000
<http://localhost:3000>`_.


Add Posts
---------

Using the standard Rails scaffolding, Mongoid can generate the necessary
model, controller and view files for our blog so that we can quickly begin
creating blog posts:

.. code-block:: sh

    bin/rails g scaffold Post title:string body:text

Navigate to `localhost:3000/posts <http://localhost:3000/posts>`_
to create posts and see the posts that have already been created.

Add Comments
------------

To make our application more interactive, let's add the ability for users to
add comments to our posts.

Create the ``Comment`` model:

.. code-block:: sh

    bin/rails g scaffold Comment name:string message:string post:belongs_to

Open the ``Post`` model file, ``app/models/post.rb``, and add a ``has_many``
association for the comments:

.. code-block:: ruby
  :name: app/models/post.rb
  :caption: app/models/post.rb

    class Post
      include Mongoid::Document
      include Mongoid::Timestamps
      field :title, type: String
      field :body, type: String

      has_many :comments, dependent: :destroy
    end

Open ``app/views/posts/show.html.erb`` and add
a section rendering existing comments and prompting to leave a new comment:

.. code-block:: erb
  :name: app/views/posts/show.html.erb
  :caption: app/views/posts/show.html.erb

  <section class="section comments">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="subtitle is-5">
        <strong><%= @post.comments.count %></strong> Comments
      </h2>
      <%= render @post.comments %>
      <div class="comment-form">
        <hr />
        <h3 class="subtitle is-3">Leave a reply</h3>
        <%= render partial: 'comments/form', locals: { comment: @post.comments.build } %>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

Open ``app/views/comments/_form.html.erb`` and change the type of field for ``:message``
from ``text_field`` to ``text_area``, as well as the type of field for
``:post_id`` from ``text_field`` to ``hidden_field``. The result
should look like this:

.. code-block:: erb
  :name: app/views/comments/_form.html.erb
  :caption: app/views/comments/_form.html.erb

  <%= form_with(model: comment, local: true) do |form| %>
    <% if comment.errors.any? %>
      <div id="error_explanation">
        <h2><%= pluralize(comment.errors.count, "error") %> prohibited this comment from being saved:</h2>

        <ul>
          <% comment.errors.full_messages.each do |message| %>
            <li><%= message %></li>
          <% end %>
        </ul>
      </div>
    <% end %>

    <div class="field">
      <%= form.label :name %>
      <%= form.text_field :name %>
    </div>

    <div class="field">
      <%= form.label :message %>
      <%= form.text_area :message %>
    </div>

    <div class="field">
      <%= form.hidden_field :post_id %>
    </div>

    <div class="actions">
      <%= form.submit %>
    </div>
  <% end %>

Next replace ``app/view/comments/_comment.html.erb`` with the following contents:

.. code-block:: erb
  :name: app/views/comments/_comment.html.erb
  :caption: app/views/comments/_comment.html.erb

  <p>
    <strong><%= comment.name %>:</strong>
    <%= comment.message %>
    <%= link_to 'Delete', [comment],
      data: {
        "turbo-method": :delete,
        "turbo-confirm": 'Are you sure?'
      } %>
  </p>


You should now be able to leave comments for the posts:

  :alt: Screenshot of the blog with a new comment being added


Existing Application
====================

Mongoid can be easily added to an existing Rails application and run alongside other ActiveRecord
adapters. If this is your use case, updating dependencies and populating the configuration file will
allow you to start using MongoDB within your application.

To switch an existing Ruby on Rails application to use Mongoid instead of ActiveRecord additional
configuration changes will be required, as described below.

Dependencies
------------

First, the ``mongoid`` gem will need to be added your ``Gemfile``.

.. code-block:: ruby
  :name: Gemfile
  :caption: Gemfile

    gem 'mongoid'

If Mongoid will be the **only** database adapter, remove or comment out any RDBMS libraries
like ``sqlite`` or ``pg`` mentioned in the ``Gemfile``.

Install gem dependencies:

.. code-block:: sh

    bundle install

Mongoid Configuration
---------------------

Generate the default Mongoid configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

    bin/rails g mongoid:config

This generator will create the ``config/mongoid.yml`` configuration file,
which is used to configure the connection to the MongoDB deployment.

Review the sections `Configure for Self Managed MongoDB`_ and `Configure for MongoDB Atlas`_
to decide how you would like to deploy MongoDB, and adjust the Mongoid
configuration (``config/mongoid.yml``) to match.

Loaded Frameworks
-----------------

Examine ``config/application.rb``. If it is requiring all components of Rails
via ``require 'rails/all'``, change it to require individual frameworks. To verify the contents of
``rails/all`` for your version see the `Github Repository
<https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/7-0-stable/railties/lib/rails/all.rb>`_:

.. code-block:: ruby
  :name: config/application.rb
  :caption: config/application.rb

  # Remove or comment out
  #require "rails/all"

  # Add the following instead of "rails/all":
  require "rails"

  # require "active_record/railtie" rescue LoadError
  # require "active_storage/engine" rescue LoadError
  require "action_controller/railtie" rescue LoadError
  require "action_view/railtie" rescue LoadError
  require "action_mailer/railtie" rescue LoadError
  require "active_job/railtie" rescue LoadError
  require "action_cable/engine" rescue LoadError
  # require "action_mailbox/engine" rescue LoadError
  # require "action_text/engine" rescue LoadError
  require "rails/test_unit/railtie" rescue LoadError

.. warning::

    Due to their reliance on ActiveRecord, `ActionText <https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_text_overview.html>`_,
    `ActiveStorage <https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html>`_ and
    `ActionMailbox <https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailbox_basics.html>`_ cannot be used
    with Mongoid.

ActiveRecord Configuration
--------------------------

Review all configuration files (``config/application.rb``,
``config/environments/{development,production.test}.rb``) and remove or
comment out any references to ``config.active_record`` and
``config.active_storage``.

Adjust Models
-------------

If your application already has models, these will need to be changed when
migrating from ActiveRecord to Mongoid.

ActiveRecord models derive from ``ApplicationRecord`` and do not have
column definitions. Mongoid models generally have no superclass but must
include ``Mongoid::Document``, and usually define the fields explicitly
(but :ref:`dynamic fields <dynamic-fields>` may also be used instead of
explicit field definitions).

For example, a bare-bones Post model may look like this in ActiveRecord:

.. code-block:: ruby
  :name: app/models/post.rb
  :caption: app/models/post.rb

  class Post < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :comments, dependent: :destroy
  end

The same model may look like this in Mongoid:

.. code-block:: ruby
  :name: app/models/post.rb
  :caption: app/models/post.rb

  class Post
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :title, type: String
    field :body, type: String

    has_many :comments, dependent: :destroy
  end

Or like this with dynamic fields:

.. code-block:: ruby
  :name: app/models/post.rb
  :caption: app/models/post.rb

  class Post
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic

    has_many :comments, dependent: :destroy
  end

Mongoid does not utilize ActiveRecord migrations, since MongoDB does not
require a schema to be defined prior to storing data.

Data Migration
--------------

If you already have data in a relational database that you would like to
transfer to MongoDB, you will need to perform a data migration. As noted
above, no schema migration is necessary because MongoDB does not require
a predefined schema to store the data.

The migration tools are often specific to the data being migrated because,
even though Mongoid supports a superset of ActiveRecord associations,
the way that model references are stored in collections differs between
Mongoid and ActiveRecord. With that said, MongoDB has
some resources on migrating from an RDBMS to MongoDB such as the
`RDBMS to MongoDB Migration Guide <https://s3.amazonaws.com/info-mongodb-com/RDBMStoMongoDBMigration.pdf>`_ and
`Modernization Guide <https://www.mongodb.com/modernize>`_.


Rails API
---------

The process for creating a Rails API application with Mongoid is the same
as when creating a regular application, with the only change being the
``--api`` parameter to ``rails new``. Migrating a Rails API application to
Mongoid follows the same process described above for regular Rails applications.

A complete Rails API application similar to the one described in this tutorial
can be found in the `mongoid-demo GitHub repository
<https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid-demo/tree/master/rails-api>`_.
