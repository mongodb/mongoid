Mongoid is customarily configured through a ``mongoid.yml`` file that specifies
options and clients. The simplest configuration is as follows, which configures
Mongoid to talk to a MongoDB server at "localhost:27017" and use the database
named "mongoid".

.. code-block:: yaml

  development:
    clients:
      default:
        database: mongoid
        hosts:
          - localhost:27017

The top level key in the configuration file, ``development`` in the above
example, refers to the environment name which the application is executing in,
i.e. ``development``, ``test`` or ``production``. The third level key,
``default`` in the above example, refers to the Mongo client name.
Most applications will use a single client named ``default``.

Generating Default Configuration
================================

If you are using Ruby on Rails, you can have Mongoid generate a default
configuration file for you by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  rails g mongoid:config

The configuration file will be placed in ``config/mongoid.yml``.

If you are not using Ruby on Rails, you can copy the minimal configuration
given above and save it as ``config/mongoid.yml``.

Loading Mongoid Configuration
=============================

If you are using Ruby on Rails, Mongoid configuration is automatically loaded
for the current environment as stored in ``Rails.env`` when the application
loads.

You may need to configure the ORM for your application to be Mongoid by
adding the following to ``application.rb``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  config.generators do |g|
    g.orm :mongoid
  end

If you are not using Ruby on Rails, Mongoid configuration must be loaded
manually. This can be done via the ``Mongoid.load!`` method, which takes
the configuration file path as its argument, as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Use automatically detected environment name
  Mongoid.load!("path/to/your/mongoid.yml")
  
  # Specify environment name manually
  Mongoid.load!("path/to/your/mongoid.yml", :production)

When Mongoid is asked to automatically detect the environment name,
it does so by examining the following sources, in order:

- If ``Rails`` top level constant is defined, ``Rails.env``.
- If ``Sinatra`` top level constant is defined, ``Sinatra::Base.environment``.
- The ``RACK_ENV`` environment variable.
- The ``MONGOID_ENV`` environment variable.

It is also possible to configure Mongoid directly in Ruby, without using
a configuration file. This configuration style does not support the concept
of environments - whatever configuration is provided, it is applied to the
current environment - but it does support defining multiple clients.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongoid.configure do |config|
    config.clients.default = {
      hosts: ['localhost:27017'],
      database: 'my_db',
    }
    
    config.log_level = :warn
  end

.. note::

  Mongoid must be configured *before* any component of it is used or referenced.
  Once a component is used or referenced, changing configuration may not apply
  changes to already instantiated components.

Mongoid Configuration
---------------------

The following annotated example ``mongoid.yml`` demonstrates how Mongoid
can be configured.

.. code-block:: yaml

  development:

        # Please see driver documentation for details. Alternatively, you can
        # define the following:

        # Define the name of the default database that Mongoid can connect to.
        # (required).
        database: my_db

The Ruby driver options may be found in 
`the driver documentation <https://docs.mongodb.com/ruby-driver/current/tutorials/ruby-driver-create-client/>`_.

ERb Preprocessing
`````````````````

When loading a configuration file, Mongoid processes it with ERb before
parsing it as YAML. This allows, for example, constructing the contents of
the configuration file at runtime based on environment variables:

.. code-block:: yaml

  development:
    clients:
      default:
        uri: "<%= ENV['MONGODB_URI'] %>"

.. note::

  When outputting values from ERb, ensure the values are valid YAML and
  escape them as needed.

.. note::

  Since ERb rendering is performed prior to YAML parsing, all ERb directives
  in the configuration file are evaluated, including those occurring in YAML
  comments.

Logging
=======

When configuring logging, it is important to keep in mind that Mongoid
provides a model layer on top of the MongoDB Ruby driver, and the driver
dispatches the CRUD operations to the MongoDB deployment. Therefore, some
of the logging output in an application using Mongoid comes from Mongoid
itself, and some comes from the driver.

The Mongo client is a Ruby driver client instance, therefore
the logger of a Mongo client is the Ruby driver logger, not the Mongoid
logger. In other words:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Ruby driver logger, not Mongoid logger
  Mongoid.client(:default).logger

Depending on whether Mongoid is used in a Ruby on Rails application, and how
both Mongoid and Ruby driver are configured, they may use the same logger
instance or different instances, potentially with different configurations.

In Ruby on Rails Application
----------------------------

When used in a Ruby on Rails application, Mongoid by default inherits
the logger and the log level from Rails, and sets the driver's logger
to the same logger instance:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Rails.logger === Mongoid.logger
  # => true
  
  Mongoid.logger === Mongo::Logger.logger
  # => true

To change the log level, use `standard Rails configuration
<https://guides.rubyonrails.org/debugging_rails_applications.html#log-levels>`_.
Place the following in one of environment configuration files, such as
``config/environments/production.rb``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Rails.application.configure do
    config.log_level = :debug
  end

.. note::

  The ``log_level`` Mongoid `configuration option <configuration-options>`_
  is not used when Mongoid operates in a Rails application, because Mongoid
  inherits Rails' log level in this case.

To configure either Mongoid or driver logger differently from the Rails logger,
use an initializer as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Rails.application.configure do
    config.after_initialize do
      # Change Mongoid log destination and/or level
      Mongoid.logger = Logger.new(STDERR).tap do |logger|
        logger.level = Logger::DEBUG
      end
      
      # Change driver log destination and/or level
      Mongo::Logger.logger = Logger.new(STDERR).tap do |logger|
        logger.level = Logger::DEBUG
      end
    end
  end

.. note::

  There is currently no provision in the Ruby standard library ``Logger``
  to return the log device (i.e. the ``IO`` object) that a logger is using.
  To have, for example, Mongoid and/or the Ruby driver log to the
  standard Rails log file (e.g. ``log/development.log``) but with a
  different level from standard Rails logger (``Rails.logger``), the
  file must be opened separately and the resulting ``IO`` object passed to
  the ``Logger`` constructor.

.. note::

  Since by default Mongoid sets its own logger and the driver's logger to the
  same instance as the Rails logger, modifying any of the instances affects
  all of them. For example the following changes log level for all three
  loggers, unless the application assigned a separate ``Logger`` instance
  to `Mongo::Logger.logger`` as described above:

  .. code-block:: ruby

    Mongoid::Logger.logger.level = Logger::DEBUG

Standalone
----------

When not loaded in a Ruby on Rails application, Mongoid respects the
``log_level`` top level `configuration option <configuration-options>`_.
It can be given in the configuration file as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

  development:
    clients:
      default:
        # ...
    options:
      log_level: :debug

... or when configuring Mongoid inline:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongoid.configure do |config|
    config.log_level = :debug
  end

The default log destination in Mongoid 7.1 and higher is standard error.
The default log destination in Mongoid 7.0 and lower is standard output.
To change the log destination, create a new logger instance as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongoid.logger = Logger.new(STDERR).tap do |logger|
    logger.level = Logger::DEBUG
  end

To change the Ruby driver log level or destination:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Logger.logger = Logger.new(STDERR).tap do |logger|
    logger.level = Logger::DEBUG
  end

To set the driver logger to be the same as the Mongoid logger:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Logger.logger = Mongoid.logger

.. note::

  Mongoid does not alter the driver's logger when running in
  standalone mode.

.. _time-zones:

Time Zones
==========

Ruby has limited time zone support in the standard library. ActiveSupport
(which Mongoid depends on) offers more comprehensive time zone support.
Importantly, Ruby and ActiveSupport may be configured with different default
time zones.

While a thorough treatment of time zones in Ruby is outside the scope
of this tutorial, the easiest and most reliable way of achieving correct
time zone handling is as follows:

1. Set the operating system's time zone to UTC. For example, on Linux:

.. code-block:: bash

  cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/UTC /etc/localtime 

2. Set ActiveSupport's time zone to UTC:

.. code-block:: ruby
  
  # If using Rails, in application.rb:
  class Application < Rails::Application
    config.time_zone = 'UTC'
  end

  # If not using Rails:
  Time.zone = 'UTC'

3. Store and persist all times in UTC. Perform all calculations on times
   in UTC.
4. When working with user input in local time, convert such user input to UTC
   times as soon as possible, and then work with the UTC times.
5. When rendering or otherwise presenting times, convert them to local time
   after performing all calculations, when actually rendering.
6. Date to time (for example, the time when a particular day starts or ends)
   conversions are a common source of errors. Such conversions should generally
   be performed while explicitly specifying the time zone in which the date
   is understood to be.

Applications using Mongoid should generally configure ActiveSupport's
time zone as described above, and then use ``Time.zone`` rather than ``Time``
(for example, ``Time.zone.now`` instead of ``Time.now``) to invoke the
ActiveSupport time zone machinery. This also helps achieve correct results
when the system time zone is not UTC, as is common in development environments.

Note that MongoDB stores all times in UTC without time zone information.

Mongoid offers the following time zone-related configuration options:

- ``use_activesupport_time_zone``: If true, prefer to work with times using
  ``ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone``. Values in fields of type ``Time``
  will be returned as instances of ``ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone``.
  When parsing times without time zone information (such as when
  mongoizing strings or arrays to time), assume the times are specified
  in ActiveSupport's time zone. This is the default.
  
  If false, prefer to work with times using Ruby standard library ``Time`` class.
  Values in fields of type ``Time`` will be returned as ``Time`` instances.
  When parsing times without time zone information, assume the times
  are specified in the Ruby time zone.
  
  Note that the ``use_activesupport_time_zone`` setting does not affect
  fields of types ``Date`` or ``DateTime``, which use ``Date`` and
  ``DateTime`` classes for their values, respectively.
  
  Also note that Mongoid may still utilize both ``Time`` and
  ``ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone`` classes internally, as appropriate,
  regardless of the ``use_activesupport_time_zone`` setting.
- ``use_utc``: 
  If true, times stored in MongoDB will be returned in UTC.
  If false, times stored in MongoDB will be returned in local time
  (as instances of either ``Time`` or ``ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone``,
  respectively in the Ruby default time zone or the ActiveSupport time zone,
  based on the value of ``use_activesupport_time_zone`` setting).
  The default is false.
  
  The ``use_utc`` setting does not affect how times are parsed - parsing
  is always done in local time when the input being parsed does not
  include time zone information. To parse dates in UTC, set the
  system/Ruby or ActiveSupport time zone to UTC (as mentioned above,
  setting all three to UTC leads to the fewest headaches).
  
  Setting ``use_activesupport_time_zone`` to true and ``Time.zone`` to
  UTC (and using ActiveSupport time machinery for all time-related
  operations) is recommended over setting ``use_utc`` to true.

Note that ``use_activesupport_time_zone`` and ``use_utc`` options do not
throw away time zone information when it is available. For example, a Time
instance does have an associated time zone, and this time zone will be used
even if it is different from ActiveSupport's configured time zone when
``use_activesupport_time_zone`` is true.

Usage with Forking Servers
==========================

When using Mongoid with a forking web server such as Puma, Unicorn or
Passenger, it is recommended to not perform any operations on Mongoid models
in the parent process prior to the fork.

When a process forks, Ruby threads are not transfered to the child processes
and the Ruby driver Client objects lose their background monitoring. The
application will typically seem to work just fine until the deployment
state changes (for example due to network errors, a maintenance event) at
which point the application is likely to start getting ``NoServerAvailable``
exception when performing MongoDB operations.

If the parent process needs to perform operations on the MongoDB database,
reset all clients in the workers after they forked. How to do so depends
on the web server being used.

If the parent process does not need to perform operations on the MongoDB
database after child processes are forked, close the clients in the parent
prior to forking children. If the parent process performs operations on a Mongo
client and does not close it, the parent process will continue consuming a
connection slot in the cluster and will continue monitoring the cluster for
as long as the parent remains alive.

.. note::

  The close/reconnect pattern described here should be used with Ruby driver
  version 2.6.2 or higher. Previous driver versions did not recreate
  monitoring threads when reconnecting.

Puma
----

Use the ``on_worker_boot`` hook to reconnect clients in the workers and
the ``before_fork`` hook to close clients in the parent process
(`Puma documentation <<https://puma.io/puma/>`_):

.. code-block:: ruby

  on_worker_boot do
    Mongoid::Clients.clients.each do |name, client|
      client.close
      client.reconnect
    end
  end

  before_fork do
    Mongoid.disconnect_clients
  end

Unicorn
-------

Use the ``after_fork`` hook to reconnect clients in the workers and
the ``before_fork`` hook to close clients in the parent process
(`Unicorn documentation <https://yhbt.net/unicorn/Unicorn/Configurator.html>`_):

.. code-block:: ruby

  after_fork do |server, worker|
    Mongoid::Clients.clients.each do |name, client|
      client.close
      client.reconnect
    end
  end

  before_fork do |server, worker|
    Mongoid.disconnect_clients
  end

Passenger
---------

Use the ``starting_worker_process`` hook to reconnect clients in the workers
(`Passenger documentation
<https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/indepth/ruby/spawn_methods/#unintentional-file-descriptor-sharing>`_).
Passenger does not appear to have a hook that is invoked in the parent process
before the workers are forked.

.. code-block:: ruby

  if defined?(PhusionPassenger)
    PhusionPassenger.on_event(:starting_worker_process) do |forked|
      Mongoid::Clients.clients.each do |name, client|
        client.close
        client.reconnect
      end
    end
  end


Development Configuration
=========================

Driver's default configuration is suitable for production deployment.
In development, some settings can be adjusted to provide a better developer
experience.

- ``:server_selection_timeout``: set this to a low value (e.g., ``1``)
if your MongoDB server is running locally and you start it manually. A low
server selection timeout will cause the driver to fail quickly when there is
no server running.

Sample recommended development configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

  development:
    clients:
      default:
        database: mongoid
        hosts:
          - localhost:27017
        options:
          server_selection_timeout: 1
