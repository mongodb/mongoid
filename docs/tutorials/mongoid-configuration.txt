=============
Configuration
=============

.. _mongoid-configuration:

Mongoid is customarily configured through a ``mongoid.yml`` file that specifies
options and clients. The simplest configuration is as follows, which configures
Mongoid to talk to a MongoDB server at "localhost:27017" and use the database
named "mongoid".

.. code-block:: yaml

  development:
    clients:
      default:
        database: mongoid
        hosts:
          - localhost:27017

The top level key in the configuration file, ``development`` in the above
example, refers to the environment name which the application is executing in,
i.e. ``development``, ``test`` or ``production``. The third level key,
``default`` in the above example, refers to the Mongo client name.
Most applications will use a single client named ``default``.

Rails Applications
******************

If you are using Rails, you can have Mongoid generate a default configuration
file for you by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ rails g mongoid:config

The configuration file will be placed in ``config/mongoid.yml``.

Environment Determination
*************************

When Mongoid loads its configuration, it chooses the environment to use
in the following order:

- ``Rails.env`` if using Rails.
- ``Sinatra::Base.environment`` if using Sinatra.
- ``RACK_ENV`` environment variable.
- ``MONGOID_ENV`` environment variable.

If you are not building a Rack based application and want to override the
environment programatically, you can pass a second parameter to ``load!``
as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongoid.load!("path/to/your/mongoid.yml", :production)

Depending on your version of Rails, you may also need to configure the ORM
to be Mongoid in application.rb like so:

.. code-block:: ruby

  config.generators do |g|
    g.orm :mongoid
  end

Anatomy of a Mongoid Config
***************************

Let's have a look at a full-blown ``mongoid.yml`` and explain the full power
of what Mongoid can do. The following configuration has explanation of the
various options in the comments above each key:

.. code-block:: yaml

  development:
    # Configure available database clients. (required)
    clients:
      # Define the default client. (required)
      default:
        # A uri may be defined for a client:
        # uri: 'mongodb://user:password@myhost1.mydomain.com:27017/my_db'
        # Please see driver documentation for details. Alternatively, you can
        # define the following:
        #
        # Define the name of the default database that Mongoid can connect to.
        # (required).
        database: my_db
        # Provide the hosts the default client can connect to. Must be an array
        # of host:port pairs. (required)
        hosts:
          - myhost1.mydomain.com:27017
          - myhost2.mydomain.com:27017
          - myhost3.mydomain.com:27017
        options:
          # Change the default write concern. (default = { w: 1 })
          write:
            w: 1

          # Change the default read preference. Valid options for mode are: :secondary,
          # :secondary_preferred, :primary, :primary_preferred, :nearest
          # (default: primary)
          read:
            mode: :secondary_preferred
            tag_sets:
              - use: web

          # The name of the user for authentication.
          user: 'user'

          # The password of the user for authentication.
          password: 'password'

          # The user's database roles.
          roles:
            - 'dbOwner'

          # Change the default authentication mechanism. Valid options are: :scram,
          # :mongodb_cr, :mongodb_x509, and :plain. (default on 3.0 is :scram, default

          # The name of the replica set to connect to. Servers provided as seeds that do
          # not belong to this replica set will be ignored.
          replica_set: my_replica_set

Inline Configuration
********************

It is also possible to configure Mongoid directly in Ruby, without using
a configuration file. This configuration mechanism does not support defining
multiple environments, however it does support defining multiple clients.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongoid.configure do |config|
    config.clients.default = {
      hosts: ['localhost:27017'],
      database: 'my_db',
    }
    
    config.log_level = :warn
  end

Logging
*******

Mongoid and the MongoDB Ruby driver have separate loggers and log levels.

If Mongoid is loaded in the context of a Rails application, it will
use Rails' configured logger by default. Otherwise Mongoid will configure
itself to log to ``STDOUT`` with the default log level of ``INFO``.

The Ruby driver's default log level is ``DEBUG``, and changing Mongoid's
log level does not affect the Ruby driver's log level.
However, if Mongoid is configured with a configuration file, the
log level specified in the configuration file will be applied to both
the Mongoid and the Ruby driver loggers.

To change the log levels:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Mongoid
  Mongoid.logger.level = Logger::DEBUG
  # Ruby driver
  Mongo::Logger.logger.level = Logger::INFO

*Note:* The Mongo client is a Ruby driver client instance, therefore
the logger of a Mongo client is the Ruby driver logger, not the Mongoid
logger. In other words:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Ruby driver logger, not Mongoid logger
  Mongoid.client(:default).logger == Mongo::Logger.logger

Usage with Forking Servers
**************************

When using Mongoid with a forking web server such as Unicorn, worker processes
need to recreate driver client instances to ensure that background threads
monitoring the MongoDB cluster are recreated as they are not transfered into
child processes through forks, and file descriptors and synchronization
primitives are not shared between workers.

It is recommended to not perform any operations on Mongoid models in the
parent process prior to the fork. If the parent process needs to perform
operations on the MongoDB database, reset all clients in an ``after_fork``
handler which is defined in ``unicorn.rb``:

.. code-block:: ruby

    after_fork do |server, worker|
      Mongoid.clients.each do |name, client|
        client.close
        client.reconnect
      end
    end

If the parent process does not need to perform operations on the MongoDB
cluster after child processes are forked, close the client in the parent:

.. code-block:: ruby

    before_fork do |server, worker|
      Mongoid.clients.each do |name, client|
        client.close
      end
    end

*Note:* This pattern should be used with Ruby driver version 2.6.2 or higher.
Previous driver versions did not recreate monitoring threads when reconnecting.

*Note:* If the parent process performs operations on the Mongo client and
does not close it, the parent process will continue consuming a connection slot
in the cluster and will continue monitoring the cluster for as long as the
parent remains alive.
