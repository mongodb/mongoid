Mongoid is customarily configured through a ``mongoid.yml`` file that specifies
options and clients. The simplest configuration is as follows, which configures
Mongoid to talk to a MongoDB server at "localhost:27017" and use the database
named "mongoid".

.. code-block:: yaml

  development:
    clients:
      default:
        database: mongoid
        hosts:
          - localhost:27017

The top level key in the configuration file, ``development`` in the above
example, refers to the environment name which the application is executing in,
i.e. ``development``, ``test`` or ``production``. The third level key,
``default`` in the above example, refers to the Mongo client name.
Most applications will use a single client named ``default``.

Rails Applications
******************

If you are using Rails, you can have Mongoid generate a default configuration
file for you by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ rails g mongoid:config

The configuration file will be placed in ``config/mongoid.yml``.

Environment Determination
*************************

When Mongoid loads its configuration, it chooses the environment to use
in the following order:

- ``Rails.env`` if using Rails.
- ``Sinatra::Base.environment`` if using Sinatra.
- ``RACK_ENV`` environment variable.
- ``MONGOID_ENV`` environment variable.

If you are not building a Rack based application and want to override the
environment programatically, you can pass a second parameter to ``load!``
as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongoid.load!("path/to/your/mongoid.yml", :production)

Depending on your version of Rails, you may also need to configure the ORM
to be Mongoid in application.rb like so:

.. code-block:: ruby

  config.generators do |g|
    g.orm :mongoid
  end

Anatomy of a Mongoid Config
***************************

Let's have a look at a full-blown ``mongoid.yml`` and explain the full power
of what Mongoid can do. The following configuration has explanation of the
various options in the comments above each key:

.. code-block:: yaml

  development:
    # Configure available database clients. (required)
    clients:
      # Define the default client. (required)
      default:
        # A uri may be defined for a client:
        # uri: 'mongodb://user:password@myhost1.mydomain.com:27017/my_db'
        # Please see driver documentation for details. Alternatively, you can
        # define the following:
        #
        # Define the name of the default database that Mongoid can connect to.
        # (required).
        database: my_db
        # Provide the hosts the default client can connect to. Must be an array
        # of host:port pairs. (required)
        hosts:
          - myhost1.mydomain.com:27017
          - myhost2.mydomain.com:27017

The Ruby driver options may be found in 
`the driver documentation <https://docs.mongodb.com/ruby-driver/current/tutorials/ruby-driver-create-client/>`_.

Inline Configuration
********************

It is also possible to configure Mongoid directly in Ruby, without using
a configuration file. This configuration mechanism does not support defining
multiple environments, however it does support defining multiple clients.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongoid.configure do |config|
    config.clients.default = {
      hosts: ['localhost:27017'],
      database: 'my_db',
    }
    
    config.log_level = :warn
  end

Logging
*******

Mongoid and the MongoDB Ruby driver have separate loggers and log levels.

If Mongoid is loaded in the context of a Rails application, it will
use Rails' configured logger by default. Otherwise Mongoid will configure
itself to log to ``STDOUT`` with the default log level of ``INFO``.

The Ruby driver's default log level is ``DEBUG``, and changing Mongoid's
log level does not affect the Ruby driver's log level.
However, if Mongoid is configured with a configuration file, the
log level specified in the configuration file will be applied to both
the Mongoid and the Ruby driver loggers.

To change the log levels:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Mongoid
  Mongoid.logger.level = Logger::DEBUG
  # Ruby driver
  Mongo::Logger.logger.level = Logger::INFO

*Note:* The Mongo client is a Ruby driver client instance, therefore
the logger of a Mongo client is the Ruby driver logger, not the Mongoid
logger. In other words:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Ruby driver logger, not Mongoid logger
  Mongoid.client(:default).logger == Mongo::Logger.logger

.. _time-zones:

Time Zones
**********

Ruby has limited time zone support in the standard library. ActiveSupport
(which Mongoid depends on) offers more comprehensive time zone support.
Importantly, Ruby and ActiveSupport may be configured with different default
time zones.

While a thorough treatment of time zones in Ruby is outside the scope
of this tutorial, the easiest and most reliable way of achieving correct
time zone handling is as follows:

1. Set the operating system's time zone to UTC. For example, on Linux:

.. code-block:: bash

  cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/UTC /etc/localtime 

2. Set ActiveSupport's time zone to UTC:

.. code-block:: ruby
  
  # If using Rails, in application.rb:
  class Application < Rails::Application
    config.time_zone = 'UTC'
  end

  # If not using Rails:
  Time.zone = 'UTC'

3. Store and persist all times in UTC. Perform all calculations on times
   in UTC.
4. When working with user input in local time, convert such user input to UTC
   times as soon as possible, and then work with the UTC times.
5. When rendering or otherwise presenting times, convert them to local time
   after performing all calculations, when actually rendering.
6. Date to time (for example, the time when a particular day starts or ends)
   conversions are a common source of errors. Such conversions should generally
   be performed while explicitly specifying the time zone in which the date
   is understood to be.

Applications using Mongoid should generally configure ActiveSupport's
time zone as described above, and then use ``Time.zone`` rather than ``Time``
(for example, ``Time.zone.now`` instead of ``Time.now``) to invoke the
ActiveSupport time zone machinery. This also helps achieve correct results
when the system time zone is not UTC, as is common in development environments.

Note that MongoDB stores all times in UTC without time zone information.

Mongoid offers the following time zone-related configuration options:

- ``use_activesupport_time_zone``: If true, prefer to work with times using
  ``ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone``. Values in fields of type ``Time``
  will be returned as instances of ``ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone``.
  When parsing times without time zone information (such as when
  mongoizing strings or arrays to time), assume the times are specified
  in ActiveSupport's time zone. This is the default.
  
  If false, prefer to work with times using Ruby standard library ``Time`` class.
  Values in fields of type ``Time`` will be returned as ``Time`` instances.
  When parsing times without time zone information, assume the times
  are specified in the Ruby time zone.
  
  Note that the ``use_activesupport_time_zone`` setting does not affect
  fields of types ``Date`` or ``DateTime``, which use ``Date`` and
  ``DateTime`` classes for their values, respectively.
  
  Also note that Mongoid may still utilize both ``Time`` and
  ``ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone`` classes internally, as appropriate,
  regardless of the ``use_activesupport_time_zone`` setting.
- ``use_utc``: 
  If true, times stored in MongoDB will be returned in UTC.
  If false, times stored in MongoDB will be returned in local time
  (as instances of either ``Time`` or ``ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone``,
  respectively in the Ruby default time zone or the ActiveSupport time zone,
  based on the value of ``use_activesupport_time_zone`` setting).
  The default is false.
  
  The ``use_utc`` setting does not affect how times are parsed - parsing
  is always done in local time when the input being parsed does not
  include time zone information. To parse dates in UTC, set the
  system/Ruby or ActiveSupport time zone to UTC (as mentioned above,
  setting all three to UTC leads to the fewest headaches).
  
  Setting ``use_activesupport_time_zone`` to true and ``Time.zone`` to
  UTC (and using ActiveSupport time machinery for all time-related
  operations) is recommended over setting ``use_utc`` to true.

Note that ``use_activesupport_time_zone`` and ``use_utc`` options do not
throw away time zone information when it is available. For example, a Time
instance does have an associated time zone, and this time zone will be used
even if it is different from ActiveSupport's configured time zone when
``use_activesupport_time_zone`` is true.

Usage with Forking Servers
**************************

When using Mongoid with a forking web server such as Unicorn, worker processes
need to recreate driver client instances to ensure that background threads
monitoring the MongoDB cluster are recreated as they are not transfered into
child processes through forks, and file descriptors and synchronization
primitives are not shared between workers.

It is recommended to not perform any operations on Mongoid models in the
parent process prior to the fork. If the parent process needs to perform
operations on the MongoDB database, reset all clients in an ``after_fork``
handler which is defined in ``unicorn.rb``:

.. code-block:: ruby

    after_fork do |server, worker|
      Mongoid.clients.each do |name, client|
        client.close
        client.reconnect
      end
    end

If the parent process does not need to perform operations on the MongoDB
cluster after child processes are forked, close the client in the parent:

.. code-block:: ruby

    before_fork do |server, worker|
      Mongoid.clients.each do |name, client|
        client.close
      end
    end

*Note:* This pattern should be used with Ruby driver version 2.6.2 or higher.
Previous driver versions did not recreate monitoring threads when reconnecting.

*Note:* If the parent process performs operations on the Mongo client and
does not close it, the parent process will continue consuming a connection slot
in the cluster and will continue monitoring the cluster for as long as the
parent remains alive.

Development Configuration
*************************

Driver's default configuration is suitable for production deployment.
In development, some settings can be adjusted to provide a better developer
experience.

- ``:server_selection_timeout``: set this to a low value (e.g., ``1``)
if your MongoDB server is running locally and you start it manually. A low
server selection timeout will cause the driver to fail quickly when there is
no server running.

Sample recomended development configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

  development:
    clients:
      default:
        database: mongoid
        hosts:
          - localhost:27017
        options:
          server_selection_timeout: 1
