Documents are the core objects in Mongoid and any object that is to be persisted to the
database must include ``Mongoid::Document``. The representation of a Document in MongoDB
is a BSON object that is very similar to a Ruby hash or JSON object. Documents can be stored
in their own collections in the database, or can be embedded in other Documents n levels deep.

Storage
=======

Mongoid by default stores documents in a collection that is the pluralized form of the class name.
For the following ``Person`` class, the collection the document would get stored in would be named ``people``.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
   end

Model class names cannot end with "s", because it will be considered as the pluralized form of
the word. For example "Status" would be considered as the plural form of "Statu",
which will cause a few known problems.

This is a limitation of the ``ActiveSupport::Inflector#classify`` which Mongoid uses to convert
from filenames and collection names to class names. You can overcome this by specifying a custom
inflection rule for your model class. For example, the following code will take care of the model
named ``Status``.

.. code-block:: ruby

   ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections do |inflect|
     inflect.singular("status", "status")
   end

The collection for the model's documents can be changed at the class level if you would like
them persisted elsewhere. You can also change the database and client the model gets persisted
in from the defaults.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     store_in collection: "citizens", database: "other", client: "analytics"
   end

The ``store_in`` macro can also take lambdas - a common case for this is multi-tenant applications.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     store_in database: ->{ Thread.current[:database] }
   end

When a document is stored in the database the ruby object will get serialized into BSON
and have a structure like so:

.. code-block:: ruby

   {
     "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9"),
     "title" : "Sir",
     "name" : {
       "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7ff"),
       "first_name" : "Durran"
     },
     "addresses" : [
       {
         "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e0"),
         "city" : "Berlin",
         "country" : "Deutschland"
       }
     ]
   }


.. _fields:

Fields
======

Even though MongoDB is a schemaless database and allows data to be stored
as strings, Mongoid permits the application to declare the type of data
stored in the various fields of a document. Field type declarations affect
the following:

1. When assigning values to fields, the values are converted to the
specified type.

2. When persisting data to MongoDB, the data is sent in an appropriate
type, permitting richer data manipulation within MongoDB or by other
tools.

3. When querying documents, query parameters are converted to the specified
type before being sent to MongoDB.

4. When retrieving documents from the database, field values are converted
to the specified type.

Field type definitions determine how Mongoid behaves when constructing the
queries, retrieving and writing fields from the database. Changing the field
definitions in a model class does not alter data already stored in
MongoDB. To update type or contents of fields of existing documents,
the field must be re-saved to the database. Note that, due to Mongoid
tracking which attributes on a model change and only saving the changed ones,
it may be necessary to explicitly write a field value when changing the
type of an existing field without changing the stored values.

Consider a simple class for modeling a person in an application. A person may
have a first name, last name, and middle name. We can define these attributes
on a person by using the ``field`` macro.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :first_name, type: String
     field :middle_name, type: String
     field :last_name, type: String
   end

Below is a list of valid types for fields.

- ``Array``
- ``BigDecimal``
- ``Boolean``
- ``Date``
- ``DateTime``
- ``Float``
- ``Hash``
- ``Integer``
- ``BSON::ObjectId``
- ``BSON::Binary``
- ``Range``
- ``Regexp``
- ``Set``
- ``String``
- ``StringifiedSymbol``
- ``Symbol``
- ``Time``
- ``TimeWithZone``

If you decide not to specify the type of field with the definition, Mongoid will treat
it as an object and not try to typecast it when sending the values to the database.
This can be advantageous as the lack of attempted conversion will yield a slight
performance gain. However some types are not supported if not defined as fields.
You can safely omit type specifications when:

- You're not using a web front end and values are already properly cast.
- All of your fields are strings.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :first_name
     field :middle_name
     field :last_name
   end

Types that are not supported as dynamic attributes since they cannot be cast are:

- ``BigDecimal``
- ``Date``
- ``DateTime``
- ``Range``

.. _stringified-symbol:

The StringifiedSymbol Type
--------------------------

The ``StringifiedSymbol`` field type is the recommended field type for storing
values that should be exposed as symbols to Ruby applications. When using the ``Symbol`` field type,
Mongoid defaults to storing values as BSON symbols. For more information on the
BSON symbol type, see :ref:`here <bson-symbol>`.
However, the BSON symbol type is deprecated and is difficult to work with in programming languages
without native symbol types, so the ``StringifiedSymbol`` type allows the use of symbols
while ensuring interoperability with other drivers. The ``StringifiedSymbol`` type stores all data
on the database as strings, while exposing values to the application as symbols.

An example usage is shown below:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Post
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :status, type: StringifiedSymbol
  end

  post = Post.new(status: :hello)
  # status is stored as "hello" on the database, but returned as a Symbol
  post.status
  # => :hello

  # String values can be assigned also:
  post = Post.new(status: "hello")
  # status is stored as "hello" on the database, but returned as a Symbol
  post.status
  # => :hello

All non-string values will be stringified upon being sent to the database (via ``to_s``), and
all values will be converted to symbols when returned to the application. Values that cannot be
converted directly to symbols, such as integers and arrays, will first be converted to strings and
then symbols before being returned to the application.

For example, setting an integer as ``status``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  post = Post.new(status: 42)
  post.status
  # => :"42"

If the ``StringifiedSymbol`` type is applied to a field that contains BSON symbols, the values
will be stored as strings instead of BSON symbols on the next save. This permits transparent lazy
migration from fields that currently store either strings or BSON symbols in the database to the
``StringifiedSymbol`` field type.

Updating Container Fields
-------------------------

Be aware that, until
`MONGOID-2951 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-2951>`_
is resolved, all fields including container ones must be assigned to for
their values to be persisted to the database.

For example, adding to a set like this does not work:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :tours, type: Set
  end

  band = Band.new
  band.tours
  # => #<Set: {}>

  band.tours << 'London'
  # => #<Set: {"London"}>
  band.tours
  # => #<Set: {}>

Instead, the field value must be modified outside of the model and assigned
back to the model as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :tours, type: Set
  end

  band = Band.new

  tours = band.tours
  # => #<Set: {}>

  tours << 'London'
  # => #<Set: {"London"}>

  band.tours = tours
  # => #<Set: {"London"}>

  band.tours
  # => #<Set: {"London"}>


Accessing Field Values
----------------------

When a field is defined, Mongoid provides several different ways of accessing the field.

.. code-block:: ruby

   # Get the value of the first_name field
   person.first_name
   person[:first_name]
   person.read_attribute(:first_name)


   # Set the value for the first_name field
   person.first_name = "Jean"
   person[:first_name] = "Jean"
   person.write_attribute(:first_name, "Jean")

You can define getters/setters that will be called when using the dot notation.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document

     field :first_name

     # custom getter
     def first_name
       "My name is Johnny"
     end

     # custom setter
     def first_name=(value)
       p 'Setting.. '
       self.first_name = value
       p '.. done!'
     end
   end

   # Like this:
   person.first_name = 'John'
   # Setting..
   # .. done!

   person.first_name                  # My name is Johnny
   person[:first_name]                # John
   person.read_attribute(:first_name) # John

In cases where you want to set multiple field values at once, there are a few different ways
of handling this as well.

.. code-block:: ruby

   # Get the field values as a hash.
   person.attributes

   # Set the field values in the document.
   Person.new(first_name: "Jean-Baptiste", middle_name: "Emmanuel")
   person.attributes = { first_name: "Jean-Baptiste", middle_name: "Emmanuel" }
   person.write_attributes(
     first_name: "Jean-Baptiste",
     middle_name: "Emmanuel"
   )

Hash Fields
-----------

When using a field of type Hash, be wary of adhering to the
`legal key names for mongoDB <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/limits/#naming-restrictions>`_,
or else the values will not store properly.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :first_name
     field :url, type: Hash

     # will update the fields properly and save the values
     def set_vals
       self.first_name = 'Daniel'
       self.url = {'home_page' => 'http://www.homepage.com'}
       save
     end

     # all data will fail to save due to the illegal hashkey
     def set_vals_fail
       self.first_name = 'Daniel'
       self.url = {'home.page' => 'http://www.homepage.com'}
       save
     end
   end

Date Fields
-----------

Mongoid allows assignment of values of several types to ``Date`` fields:

- ``Date`` - the provided date is stored as is.
- ``Time``, ``DateTime``, ``ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone`` - the date component
  of the value is taken in the value's time zone.
- ``String`` - the date specified in the string is used.
- ``Integer``, ``Float`` - the value is taken to be a UTC timestamp which is
  converted to the :ref:`configured time zone <time-zones>` (note that
  ``Mongoid.use_utc`` has no effect on this conversion), then the date is
  taken from the resulting time.

In other words, if a date is specified in the value, that date is used without
first converting the value to the configured time zone.

As a date & time to date conversion is lossy (it discards the time component),
especially if an application operates with times in different time zones it is
recommended to explicitly convert ``String``, ``Time`` and ``DateTime``
objects to ``Date`` objects before assigning the values to fields of type
``Date``.

DateTime Fields
---------------

MongoDB stores all times as UTC timestamps. When assigning a value to a
``DateTime`` field, or when querying a ``DateTime`` field, Mongoid
converts the passed in value to a UTC ``Time`` before sending it to the
MongoDB server.

``Time``, ``ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone`` and ``DateTime`` objects embed
time zone information, and the value persisted is the specified moment in
time, in UTC. When the value is retrieved, the time zone in which it is
returned is defined by the :ref:`configured time zone settings <time-zones>`.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Ticket
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :opened_at, type: DateTime
   end

   Mongoid.use_activesupport_time_zone = true
   Time.zone = 'Berlin'

   ticket = Ticket.create!(opened_at: '2018-02-18 07:00:08 -0500')

    ticket.opened_at
    # => Sun, 18 Feb 2018 13:00:08 +0100
    ticket
    # => #<Ticket _id: 5c13d4b9026d7c4e7870bb2f, opened_at: 2018-02-18 12:00:08 UTC>

    Time.zone = 'America/New_York'
    ticket.opened_at
    # => Sun, 18 Feb 2018 07:00:08 -0500

    Mongoid.use_utc = true
    ticket.opened_at
    # => Sun, 18 Feb 2018 12:00:08 +0000

Mongoid also supports casting integers and floats to ``DateTime``. When
doing so, the integers/floats are assumed to be Unix timestamps (in UTC):

.. code-block:: ruby

    ticket.opened_at = 1544803974
    ticket.opened_at
    # => Fri, 14 Dec 2018 16:12:54 +0000

If a string is used as a ``DateTime`` field value, the behavior depends on
whether the string includes a time zone. If no time zone is specified,
the :ref:`default Mongoid time zone <time-zones>` is used:

.. code-block:: ruby

    Time.zone = 'America/New_York'
    ticket.opened_at = 'Mar 4, 2018 10:00:00'
    ticket.opened_at
    # => Sun, 04 Mar 2018 15:00:00 +0000

If a time zone is specfied, it is respected:

.. code-block:: ruby

    ticket.opened_at = 'Mar 4, 2018 10:00:00 +01:00'
    ticket.opened_at
    # => Sun, 04 Mar 2018 09:00:00 +0000

Regular Expression Fields
-------------------------

MongoDB supports storing regular expressions in documents, and querying using
regular expressions. Of note for Ruby applications, MongoDB uses
`Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCRE) <http://pcre.org/>`_
and Ruby uses `Onigmo <https://github.com/k-takata/Onigmo>`_, which is a
fork of `Oniguruma regular expression engine <https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma>`_.
The two regular expression implementations generally provide equivalent
functionality but have several important syntax differences.

When a field is declared to be of type Regexp, Mongoid converts Ruby regular
expressions to BSON regular expressions and stores the result in MongoDB.
Retrieving the field from the database produces a ``BSON::Regexp::Raw``
instance:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Token
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :pattern, type: Regexp
  end

  token = Token.create!(pattern: /hello.world/m)
  token.pattern
  # => /hello.world/m

  token.reload
  token.pattern
  # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x0000555f505e4a20 @pattern="hello.world", @options="ms">

Use ``#compile`` method on ``BSON::Regexp::Raw`` to get back the Ruby regular
expression:

.. code-block:: ruby

  token.pattern.compile
  # => /hello.world/m

Note that, if the regular expression was not originally a Ruby one, calling
``#compile`` on it may produce a different regular expression. For example,
the following is a PCRE matching a string that ends in "hello":

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Regexp::Raw.new('hello$', 's')
  # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x0000555f51441640 @pattern="hello$", @options="s">

Compiling this regular expression produces a Ruby regular expression that
matches strings containing "hello" before a newline, besides strings ending in
"hello":

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Regexp::Raw.new('hello$', 's').compile =~ "hello\nworld"
  # => 0

This is because the meaning of ``$`` is different between PCRE and Ruby
regular expressions.

Defaults
--------

A field can be configured to have a fixed default value:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Order
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :state, type: String, default: 'created'
  end

The default value can also be specified as a ``Proc``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Order
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :fulfill_by, type: Time, default: ->{ Time.now + 3.days }
  end

.. note::

  Default values that are not ``Proc`` instances are evaluated at class load
  time, meaning the following two definitions are not equivalent:

  .. code-block:: ruby

    field :submitted_at, type: Time, default: Time.now
    field :submitted_at, type: Time, default: ->{ Time.now }

  The second definition is most likely the desired one, which causes the
  time of submission to be set to the current time at the moment of
  document instantiation.

To set a default which depends on the document's state, use ``self``
inside the ``Proc`` instance which would evaluate to the document instance
being operated on:

.. code-block:: ruby

  field :fulfill_by, type: Time, default: ->{
    # Order should be fulfilled in 2 business hours.
    if (7..8).include?(self.submitted_at.hour)
      self.submitted_at + 4.hours
    elsif (9..3).include?(self.submitted_at.hour)
      self.submitted_at + 2.hours
    else
      (self.submitted_at + 1.day).change(hour: 11)
    end
  }

When defining a default value as a ``Proc``, Mongoid will apply the default
after all other attributes are set. To have the default be applied before
the other attributes are set, use the ``pre_processed: true`` field option:

.. code-block:: ruby

  field :fulfill_by, type: Time, default: ->{ Time.now + 3.days },
    pre_processed: true


.. _storage-field-names:

Specifying Storage Field Names
------------------------------

One of the drawbacks of having a schemaless database is that MongoDB must
store all field information along with every document, meaning that it
takes up a lot of storage space in RAM and on disk. A common pattern to limit
this is to alias fields to a small number of characters, while keeping the
domain in the application expressive. Mongoid allows you to do this and
reference the fields in the domain via their long names in getters, setters,
and criteria while performing the conversion for you.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :n, as: :name, type: String
  end

  band = Band.new(name: "Placebo")
  band.attributes # { "n" => "Placebo" }

  criteria = Band.where(name: "Placebo")
  criteria.selector # { "n" => "Placebo" }


.. _field-aliases:

Field Aliases
-------------

It is possible to define field aliases. The value will be stored in the
destination field but can be accessed from either the destination field or
from the aliased field:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    field :name, type: String
    alias_attribute :n, :name
  end
  
  band = Band.new(n: 'Astral Projection')
  # => #<Band _id: 5fc1c1ee2c97a64accbeb5e1, name: "Astral Projection">
  
  band.attributes
  # => {"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('5fc1c1ee2c97a64accbeb5e1'), "name"=>"Astral Projection"}
  
  band.n
  # => "Astral Projection"

Aliases can be removed from model classes using the ``unalias_attribute``
method.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    unalias_attribute :n
  end

.. _unalias-id:

Unaliasing ``id``
`````````````````

``unalias_attribute`` can be used to remove the predefined ``id`` alias.
This is useful for storing different values in ``id`` and ``_id`` fields:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    unalias_attribute :id
    field :id, type: String
  end
  
  Band.new(id: '42')
  # => #<Band _id: 5fc1c3f42c97a6590684046c, id: "42">


Custom Fields
-------------

You can define custom types in Mongoid and determine how they are serialized and deserialized.
You simply need to provide three methods on it for Mongoid to call to convert your object to
and from MongoDB friendly values.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Profile
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :location, type: Point
   end

   class Point

     attr_reader :x, :y

     def initialize(x, y)
       @x, @y = x, y
     end

     # Converts an object of this instance into a database friendly value.
     def mongoize
       [ x, y ]
     end

     class << self

       # Get the object as it was stored in the database, and instantiate
       # this custom class from it.
       def demongoize(object)
         Point.new(object[0], object[1])
       end

       # Takes any possible object and converts it to how it would be
       # stored in the database.
       def mongoize(object)
         case object
         when Point then object.mongoize
         when Hash then Point.new(object[:x], object[:y]).mongoize
         else object
         end
       end

       # Converts the object that was supplied to a criteria and converts it
       # into a database friendly form.
       def evolve(object)
         case object
         when Point then object.mongoize
         else object
         end
       end
     end
   end

The instance method ``mongoize`` takes an instance of your object, and converts it
into how it will be stored in the database. In our example above, we want to store our
point object as an array in the form ``[ x, y ]``.

The class method ``demongoize`` takes an object as how it was stored in the database,
and is responsible for instantiating an object of your custom type. In this case, we
take an array and instantiate a ``Point`` from it.

The class method ``mongoize`` takes an object that you would use to set on your model
from your application code, and create the object as it would be stored in the database.
This is for cases where you are not passing your model instances of your custom type in the setter:

.. code-block:: ruby

   point = Point.new(12, 24)
   venue = Venue.new(location: point) # This uses the mongoize instance method.
   venue = Venue.new(location: [ 12, 24 ]) # This uses the mongoize class method.

The class method ``evolve`` takes an object, and determines how it is to be transformed
for use in criteria. For example we may want to write a query like so:

.. code-block:: ruby

   point = Point.new(12, 24)
   Venue.where(location: point)

Note that when accessing custom fields from the document, you will get a new instance
of that object with each call to the getter. This is because Mongoid is generating a new
object from the raw attributes on each access.

We need the point object in the criteria to be transformed to a Mongo friendly value when
it is not as well, ``evolve`` is the method that takes care of this. We check if the passed
in object is a ``Point`` first, in case we also want to be able to pass in ordinary arrays instead.

Reserved Names
--------------

Attempting to define a field on a document that conflicts with a reserved
method name in Mongoid will raise an error. The list of reserved names can
be obtained by invoking the ``Mongoid.destructive_fields`` method.

Field Redefinition
------------------

By default Mongoid allows redefining fields on a model. To raise an error
when a field is redefined, set the ``duplicate_fields_exception``
:ref:`configuration option <configuration-options>` to ``true``.

With the option set to true, the following example will raise an error:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :name

    field :name, type: String
  end

To define the field anyway, use the ``overwrite: true`` option:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :name

    field :name, type: String, overwrite: true
  end


.. _custom-id:

Custom Ids
----------

By default, Mongoid defines the ``_id`` field on documents to contain a
``BSON::ObjcetId`` value which is automatically generated by Mongoid.

It is possible to replace the ``_id`` field definition to change the type
of the ``_id`` values or have different default values:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    field :_id, type: String, default: ->{ name }
  end

It is possible to omit the default entirely:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :_id, type: String
  end

If the default on ``_id`` is omitted, and no ``_id`` value is provided by
your application, Mongoid will persist the document without the ``_id``
value and one will be assigned by the server. However, Mongoid will
not automatically retrieve this value when the document is persisted - you
must obtain the persisted value (and the complete persisted document) using
other means:

.. code-block:: ruby

  band = Band.create!
  => #<Band _id: , >
  band.id
  => nil
  band.reload
  # raises Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound
  Band.last
  => #<Band _id: 5fc681c22c97a6791f324b99, >

Omitting ``_id`` fields is more common in :ref:`embedded documents <omit-id>`.

Mongoid also defines the ``id`` field aliased to ``_id``. The ``id``
alias can :ref:`be removed <unalias-id>` if desired (such as to integrate
with systems that use the ``id`` field to store value different from ``_id``.


.. _bson-symbol:

BSON Symbol Type
----------------

New applications should use the :ref:`StringifiedSymbol field type <stringified-symbol>`
to store Ruby symbols in the database. The ``StringifiedSymbol`` field type
provides maximum compatibility with other applications and programming languages
and has the same behavior in all circumstances.

Mongoid also provides the deprecated ``Symbol`` field type for serializing
Ruby symbols to BSON symbols. Because the BSON specification deprecated the
BSON symbol type, the `bson` gem will serialize Ruby symbols into BSON strings
when used on its own. However, in order to maintain backwards compatibility
with older datasets, the `mongo` gem overrides this behavior to serialize Ruby
symbols as BSON symbols. This is necessary to be able to specify queries for
documents which contain BSON symbols as fields.

To override the default behavior and configure the ``mongo`` gem (and thereby
Mongoid as well) to encode symbol values as strings, include the following code
snippet in your project:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Symbol
    def bson_type
      BSON::String::BSON_TYPE
    end
  end


.. _dynamic-fields:

Dynamic Fields
==============

By default, Mongoid requires all fields that may be set on a document to
be explicitly defined using ``field`` declarations. Mongoid also supports
creating fields on the fly from an arbitrary hash or documents stored in
the database. When a model uses fields not explicitly defined, such fields
are called *dynamic fields*.

To enable dynamic fields, include ``Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic`` module
in the model:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic
  end

  bob = Person.new(name: 'Bob', age: 42)
  bob.name
  # => "Bob"

It is possible to use ``field`` declarations and dynamic fields in the same
model class. Attributes for which there is a ``field`` declaration will be
treated according to the ``field`` declaration, with remaining attributes
being treated as dynamic fields.

Attribute values in the dynamic fields must initially be set by either
passing the attribute hash to the constructor, mass assignment via
``attributes=``, mass assignment via ``[]=``, using ``write_attribute``,
or they must already be present in the database.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # OK
  bob = Person.new(name: 'Bob')

  # OK
  bob = Person.new
  bob.attributes = {age: 42}

  # OK
  bob = Person.new
  bob['age'] = 42

  # Raises NoMethodError: undefined method age=
  bob = Person.new
  bob.age = 42

  # OK
  bob = Person.new
  # OK - string access
  bob.write_attribute('age', 42)
  # OK - symbol access
  bob.write_attribute(:name, 'Bob')

  # OK, initializes attributes from whatever is in the database
  bob = Person.find('123')

If an attribute is not present in a particular model instance's attributes
hash, both the reader and the writer for the corresponding field are not
defined, and invoking them raises ``NoMethodError``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  bob = Person.new
  bob.attributes = {age: 42}

  bob.age
  # => 42

  # raises NoMethodError
  bob.name

  # raises NoMethodError
  bob.name = 'Bob'

  # OK
  bob['name'] = 'Bob'

  bob.name
  # => "Bob"

Attributes can always be read using mass attribute access or ``read_attribute``
(this appies to models not using dynamic fields as well):

.. code-block:: ruby

  bob = Person.new(age: 42)

  # OK - string access
  bob['name']
  # => nil

  # OK - symbol access
  bob[:name]
  # => nil

  # OK - string access
  bob['age']
  # => 42

  # OK - symbol access
  bob[:age]
  # => 42

  # OK
  bob.attributes['name']
  # => nil

  # OK
  bob.attributes['age']
  # => 42

  # Returns nil - keys are always strings
  bob.attributes[:age]
  # => nil

  # OK
  bob.read_attribute('name')
  # => nil

  # OK
  bob.read_attribute(:name)
  # => nil

  # OK - string access
  bob.read_attribute('age')
  # => 42

  # OK - symbol access
  bob.read_attribute(:age)
  # => 42


Special Characters in Field Names
---------------------------------

Mongoid permits dynamic field names to include spaces and punctuation:

.. code-block:: ruby

  bob = Person.new('hello world' => 'MDB')
  bob.send('hello world')
  # => "MDB"

  bob.write_attribute("hello%world", 'MDB')
  bob[:"hello%world"]
  # => "MDB"


Localized Fields
================

Mongoid supports localized fields via `i18n <https://github.com/ruby-i18n/i18n>`_.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Product
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :description, localize: true
   end

By telling the field to ``localize``, Mongoid will under the covers store the field
as a hash of locale/value pairs, but normal access to it will behave like a string.

.. code-block:: ruby

   I18n.default_locale = :en
   product = Product.new
   product.description = "Marvelous!"
   I18n.locale = :de
   product.description = "Fantastisch!"

   product.attributes
   # { "description" => { "en" => "Marvelous!", "de" => "Fantastisch!" }

You can get and set all the translations at once by using the corresponding ``_translations`` method.

.. code-block:: ruby

   product.description_translations
   # { "en" => "Marvelous!", "de" => "Fantastisch!" }
   product.description_translations =
     { "en" => "Marvelous!", "de" => "Wunderbar!" }


Fallbacks
---------

Mongoid integrates with
`i18n fallbacks <https://github.com/ruby-i18n/i18n/wiki/Fallbacks>`_.
To use the fallbacks, the respective functionality must be explicitly enabled.

In a Rails application, set the ``config.i18n.fallbacks`` configuration setting
to ``true`` in your environment and specify the fallback languages:

.. code-block:: ruby

  config.i18n.fallbacks = true
  config.after_initialize do
    I18n.fallbacks[:de] = [ :en, :es ]
  end

In a non-Rails application, include the fallbacks module into the I18n backend
you are using and specify the fallback languages:

.. code-block:: ruby

  require "i18n/backend/fallbacks"
  I18n::Backend::Simple.send(:include, I18n::Backend::Fallbacks)
  I18n.fallbacks[:de] = [ :en, :es ]

When fallbacks are enabled, if a translation is not present in the active
language, translations will be looked up in the fallback languages:

.. code-block:: ruby

  product = Product.new
  I18n.locale = :en
  product.description = "Marvelous!"
  I18n.locale = :de
  product.description # "Marvelous!"

.. note::

  In i18n 1.1, the behavior of fallbacks `changed <https://github.com/ruby-i18n/i18n/pull/415>`_
  to always require an explicit list of fallback locales rather than falling
  back to the default locale when no fallback locales have been provided.


Querying
--------

When querying for localized fields using Mongoid's criteria API, Mongoid will automatically
alter the criteria to match the current locale.

.. code-block:: ruby

   # Match all products with Marvelous as the description. Locale is en.
   Product.where(description: "Marvelous!")
   # The resulting MongoDB query filter: { "description.en" : "Marvelous!" }

Indexing
--------

If you plan to be querying extensively on localized fields, you should index each of the
locales that you plan on searching on.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Product
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :description, localize: true

     index "description.de" => 1
     index "description.en" => 1
   end

Dirty Tracking
==============

Mongoid supports tracking of changed or "dirty" fields with an API that mirrors that of
Active Model. If a defined field has been modified in a model the model will be marked as
dirty and some additional behavior comes into play.

Viewing Changes
---------------

There are various ways to view what has been altered on a model. Changes are recorded
from the time a document is instantiated, either as a new document or via loading from
the database up to the time it is saved. Any persistence operation clears the changes.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :name, type: String
   end

   person = Person.first
   person.name = "Alan Garner"

   # Check to see if the document has changed.
   person.changed? # true

   # Get an array of the names of the changed fields.
   person.changed # [ :name ]

   # Get a hash of the old and changed values for each field.
   person.changes # { "name" => [ "Alan Parsons", "Alan Garner" ] }

   # Check if a specific field has changed.
   person.name_changed? # true

   # Get the changes for a specific field.
   person.name_change # [ "Alan Parsons", "Alan Garner" ]

   # Get the previous value for a field.
   person.name_was # "Alan Parsons"

Resetting Changes
-----------------

You can reset changes of a field to its previous value by calling the reset method.

.. code-block:: ruby

   person = Person.first
   person.name = "Alan Garner"

   # Reset the changed name back to the original
   person.reset_name!
   person.name # "Alan Parsons"

Persistence
-----------

Mongoid uses dirty tracking as the core of its persistence operations. It looks at the
changes on a document and atomically updates only what has changed, unlike other frameworks
that write the entire document on each save. If no changes have been made, Mongoid will
not hit the database on a call to ``Model#save``.

Viewing Previous Changes
------------------------

After a document has been persisted, you can see what the changes were previously by
calling ``Model#previous_changes``.

.. code-block:: ruby

   person = Person.first
   person.name = "Alan Garner"
   person.save # Clears out current changes.

   # View the previous changes.
   person.previous_changes # { "name" => [ "Alan Parsons", "Alan Garner" ] }

.. _read-only:

Read-Only Attributes
====================

You can tell Mongoid that certain attributes are read-only. This will allow
documents to be created with these attributes, but changes to them will be
ignored when using mass update methods such as ``update_attributes``:

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :name, type: String
     field :origin, type: String

     attr_readonly :name, :origin
   end

   band = Band.create(name: "Placebo")
   band.update_attributes(name: "Tool") # Filters out the name change.

If you explicitly try to update or remove a read-only attribute by itself,
a ``ReadonlyAttribute`` exception will be raised:

.. code-block:: ruby

   band.update_attribute(:name, "Tool") # Raises the error.
   band.remove_attribute(:name) # Raises the error.

Inheritance
===========

Mongoid supports inheritance in both top level and embedded documents. When
a child document inherits from a parent document, the parent document's
fields, associations, validations and scopes are copied to the child document.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Canvas
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :name, type: String
     embeds_many :shapes
   end

   class Browser < Canvas
     field :version, type: Integer
     scope :recent, ->{ where(:version.gt => 3) }
   end

   class Firefox < Browser
   end

   class Shape
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :x, type: Integer
     field :y, type: Integer
     embedded_in :canvas
   end

   class Circle < Shape
     field :radius, type: Float
   end

   class Rectangle < Shape
     field :width, type: Float
     field :height, type: Float
   end

In the above example, ``Canvas``, ``Browser`` and ``Firefox`` will all save in the canvases
collection. An additional attribute ``_type`` is stored in order to make sure when loaded
from the database the correct document is returned. This also holds true for the embedded
documents ``Circle``, ``Rectangle``, and ``Shape``.

.. note::

    When searching for a ``Circle``, the query will only return documents in the shape collection
    where the ``_type`` (or whatever the discriminator key was set to) field has the value ``Circle`` (or
    whatever the discriminator value was set to), all other discriminator values will be considered an object
    of the Shape class.

    Similarly, when querying by parent classes (``Canvas`` in this example), any documents in the collection
    that do not have a discriminator value, or whose discriminator value does not map to either the parent
    or any of its descendants, will be returned as instances of the parent class.

.. _discriminator-key:

Changing the Discriminator Key
------------------------------
Mongoid supports changing the discriminator key from the default ``_type``. There are a few
cases where one might want to do this:

1. For optimization: The user might want to use a shorter key like ``_t``.

2. When trying to work with an existing system: It's possible the user is working with an existing system or dataset that has predefined keys.


There are two ways to change the discriminator key, on the class level and on the global level.
To change the discriminator key on the class level the user can set it directly on the parent class using
the ``discriminator_key=`` method.
Take the above example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Shape
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :x, type: Integer
     field :y, type: Integer
     embedded_in :canvas

     self.discriminator_key = "shape_type"
   end

   class Circle < Shape
     field :radius, type: Float
   end

   class Rectangle < Shape
     field :width, type: Float
     field :height, type: Float
   end

Here a call to the ``discriminator_key=`` setter was added to the parent class. Now, on
creation of a Rectangle or Circle, a ``shape_type`` field will be added.

Note that the discriminator key can only be modified in the parent class, and an error
will be raised if trying to set it on the child class.

If the discriminator key is changed after the child class is created, a new field is
added with the new discriminator key value, and the old field will remain unchanged.
For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Shape
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :x, type: Integer
     field :y, type: Integer
     embedded_in :canvas
   end

   class Circle < Shape
     field :radius, type: Float
   end

   class Rectangle < Shape
     field :width, type: Float
     field :height, type: Float
   end

   Shape.discriminator_key = "shape_type"

In this case, on creation of a Rectangle or Circle, there will be both a ``shape_type``
and a ``_type`` field that both default to ``Rectangle`` or ``Circle`` respectively.


The discriminator key can also be set on the global level. Meaning, all classes will
use the globally set discriminator key instead of ``_type``. Take the above example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Mongoid.discriminator_key = "_the_type"

   class Shape
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :x, type: Integer
     field :y, type: Integer
     embedded_in :canvas
   end

   class Circle < Shape
     field :radius, type: Float
   end

   class Rectangle < Shape
     field :width, type: Float
     field :height, type: Float
   end

After setting the global discriminator key, all classes will use ``_the_type`` as
the discriminator key and will not contain a ``_type`` field.

Note that when defining the discriminator key on the global level, it must be set before the
child class is defined for the child class to use that global value.
On the global level, however, if the user does not set the discriminator key before defining a child
class, the discriminator field will use the default ``_type`` and not the new global setting in
that child class.

.. _discriminator-value:

Changing the Discriminator Value
--------------------------------
Mongoid also supports changing the discriminator value from the default value, which is the class name.
One can change the discriminator value by using the ``discriminator_value=`` method on that specific class.

Take the above example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Shape
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :x, type: Integer
     field :y, type: Integer
     embedded_in :canvas
   end

   class Circle < Shape
     field :radius, type: Float

     self.discriminator_value = "round thing"
   end

   class Rectangle < Shape
     field :width, type: Float
     field :height, type: Float
   end

Here, a call to the ``discriminator_value=`` setter was added to ``Circle``.
Now, on creation of a ``Circle``, the document will contain a field with the key ``_type`` (or whatever the ``discriminator_key`` was changed to)
and the value "round thing."

Querying Subclasses
-------------------

Querying for subclasses is handled in the normal manner, and although the documents are
all in the same collection, queries will only return documents of the correct type,
similar to Single Table Inheritance in ActiveRecord.

.. code-block:: ruby

   # Returns Canvas documents and subclasses
   Canvas.where(name: "Paper")
   # Returns only Firefox documents
   Firefox.where(name: "Window 1")

Associations
------------

You can add any type of subclass to a has one or has many association, through
either normal setting or through the build and create methods on the association:

.. code-block:: ruby

   firefox = Firefox.new
   # Builds a Shape object
   firefox.shapes.build({ x: 0, y: 0 })
   # Builds a Circle object
   firefox.shapes.build({ x: 0, y: 0 }, Circle)
   # Creates a Rectangle object
   firefox.shapes.create({ x: 0, y: 0 }, Rectangle)

   rect = Rectangle.new(width: 100, height: 200)
   firefox.shapes


Timestamping
============

Mongoid supplies a timestamping module in ``Mongoid::Timestamps`` which
can be included to get basic behavior for ``created_at`` and
``updated_at`` fields.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     include Mongoid::Timestamps
   end

You may also choose to only have specific timestamps for creation or
modification.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     include Mongoid::Timestamps::Created
   end

   class Post
     include Mongoid::Document
     include Mongoid::Timestamps::Updated
   end

If you want to turn off timestamping for specific calls, use the timeless
method:

.. code-block:: ruby

   person.timeless.save
   Person.timeless.create!

If you'd like shorter timestamp fields with aliases on them to save space,
you can include the short versions of the modules.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     include Mongoid::Timestamps::Short # For c_at and u_at.
   end

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     include Mongoid::Timestamps::Created::Short # For c_at only.
   end

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     include Mongoid::Timestamps::Updated::Short # For u_at only.
   end
