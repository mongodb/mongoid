Documents are the core objects in Mongoid and any object that is to be persisted to the
database must include ``Mongoid::Document``. The representation of a Document in MongoDB
is a BSON object that is very similar to a Ruby hash or JSON object. Documents can be stored
in their own collections in the database, or can be embedded in other Documents n levels deep.

Storage
-------

Mongoid by default stores documents in a collection that is the pluralized form of the class name.
For the following ``Person`` class, the collection the document would get stored in would be named ``people``.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
   end

Model class names cannot end with "s", because it will be considered as the pluralized form of
the word. For example "Status" would be considered as the plural form of "Statu",
which will cause a few known problems.

This is a limitation of the ``ActiveSupport::Inflector#classify`` which Mongoid uses to convert
from filenames and collection names to class names. You can overcome this by specifying a custom
inflection rule for your model class. For example, the following code will take care of the model
named ``Status``.

.. code-block:: ruby

   ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections do |inflect|
     inflect.singular("status", "status")
   end

The collection for the model's documents can be changed at the class level if you would like
them persisted elsewhere. You can also change the database and client the model gets persisted
in from the defaults.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     store_in collection: "citizens", database: "other", client: "secondary"
   end

The ``store_in`` macro can also take lambdas - a common case for this is multi-tenant applications.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     store_in database: ->{ Thread.current[:database] }
   end

When a document is stored in the database the ruby object will get serialized into BSON
and have a structure like so:

.. code-block:: ruby

   {
     "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9"),
     "title" : "Sir",
     "name" : {
       "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7ff"),
       "first_name" : "Durran"
     },
     "addresses" : [
       {
         "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e0"),
         "city" : "Berlin",
         "country" : "Deutschland"
       }
     ]
   }

Fields
------

Even though MongoDB is a schemaless database, most uses will be with web applications where
form parameters always come to the server as strings. Mongoid provides an easy mechanism for
transforming these strings into their appropriate types through the definition of fields
in a ``Mongoid::Document``.

Keep in mind that the field definitions determine how Mongoid behaves when writing and reading
fields from the database. Changing the Model definition in the Model file does not change existing
data. If you'd like to update a field type or options of existing data, you must write a script to do so.
You will get errors otherwise.

Consider a simple class for modeling a person in an application. A person may have a first name,
last name, and middle name. We can define these attributes on a person by using the fields macro.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :first_name, type: String
     field :middle_name, type: String
     field :last_name, type: String
   end

Below is a list of valid types for fields.

- ``Array``
- ``BigDecimal``
- ``Boolean``
- ``Date``
- ``DateTime``
- ``Float``
- ``Hash``
- ``Integer``
- ``BSON::ObjectId``
- ``BSON::Binary``
- ``Range``
- ``Regexp``
- ``Set``
- ``String``
- ``Symbol``
- ``Time``
- ``TimeWithZone``

If you decide not to specify the type of field with the definition, Mongoid will treat
it as an object and not try to typecast it when sending the values to the database.
This can be advantageous as the lack of attempted conversion will yield a slight
performance gain. However some types are not supported if not defined as fields.
You can safely omit type specifications when:

- You're not using a web front end and values are already properly cast.
- All of your fields are strings.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :first_name
     field :middle_name
     field :last_name
   end

Types that are not supported as dynamic attributes since they cannot be cast are:

- ``BigDecimal``
- ``Date``
- ``DateTime``
- ``Range``


Updating Container Fields
*************************

Be aware that, until
`MONGOID-2951 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-2951>`_
is resolved, all fields including container ones must be assigned to for
their values to be persisted to the database.

For example, adding to a set like this does not work:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    field :tours, type: Set
  end
  
  band = Band.new
  band.tours
  # => #<Set: {}>

  band.tours << 'London'
  # => #<Set: {"London"}>
  band.tours
  # => #<Set: {}>

Instead, the field value must be modified outside of the model and assigned
back to the model as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    field :tours, type: Set
  end
  
  band = Band.new
  
  tours = band.tours
  # => #<Set: {}>

  tours << 'London'
  # => #<Set: {"London"}>
  
  band.tours = tours
  # => #<Set: {"London"}>
  
  band.tours
  # => #<Set: {"London"}>


Accessing Field Values
**********************

When a field is defined, Mongoid provides several different ways of accessing the field.

.. code-block:: ruby

   # Get the value of the first_name field
   person.first_name
   person[:first_name]
   person.read_attribute(:first_name)


   # Set the value for the first_name field
   person.first_name = "Jean"
   person[:first_name] = "Jean"
   person.write_attribute(:first_name, "Jean")

You can define getters/setters that will be called when using the dot notation.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document

     field :first_name

     # custom getter
     def first_name
       "My name is Johnny"
     end

     # custom setter
     def first_name=(value)
       p 'Setting.. '
       self.first_name = value
       p '.. done!'
     end
   end

   # Like this:
   person.first_name = 'John'
   # Setting..
   # .. done!

   person.first_name                  # My name is Johnny
   person[:first_name]                # John
   person.read_attribute(:first_name) # John

In cases where you want to set multiple field values at once, there are a few different ways
of handling this as well.

.. code-block:: ruby

   # Get the field values as a hash.
   person.attributes

   # Set the field values in the document.
   Person.new(first_name: "Jean-Baptiste", middle_name: "Emmanuel")
   person.attributes = { first_name: "Jean-Baptiste", middle_name: "Emmanuel" }
   person.write_attributes(
     first_name: "Jean-Baptiste",
     middle_name: "Emmanuel"
   )

Hash Fields
***********

When using a field of type Hash, be wary of adhering to the
`legal key names for mongoDB <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/limits/#naming-restrictions>`_,
or else the values will not store properly.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :first_name
     field :url, type: Hash

     # will update the fields properly and save the values
     def set_vals
       self.first_name = 'Daniel'
       self.url = {'home_page' => 'http://www.homepage.com'}
       save
     end

     # all data will fail to save due to the illegal hashkey
     def set_vals_fail
       self.first_name = 'Daniel'
       self.url = {'home.page' => 'http://www.homepage.com'}
       save
     end
   end

Regular Expression Fields
*************************

MongoDB supports storing regular expressions in documents, and querying using
regular expressions. Of note for Ruby applications, MongoDB uses
`Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCRE) <http://pcre.org/>`_
and Ruby uses `Onigmo <https://github.com/k-takata/Onigmo>`_, which is a
fork of `Oniguruma regular expression engine <https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma>`_.
The two regular expression implementations generally provide equivalent
functionality but have some important syntax differences.

When a field is declared to be of type Regexp, Mongoid converts Ruby regular
expressions to BSON regular expressions and stores the result in MongoDB.
Retrieving the field from the database produces a ``BSON::Regexp::Raw``
instance:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Token
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    field :pattern, type: Regexp
  end
  
  token = Token.create!(pattern: /hello.world/m)
  token.pattern
  # => /hello.world/m
  
  token.reload
  token.pattern
  # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x0000555f505e4a20 @pattern="hello.world", @options="ms">

Use ``#compile`` method on ``BSON::Regexp::Raw`` to get back the Ruby regular
expression:

.. code-block:: ruby

  token.pattern.compile
  # => /hello.world/m

Note that, if the regular expression was not originally a Ruby one, calling
``#compile`` on it may produce a different regular expression. For example,
the following is a PCRE matching a string that ends in "hello":

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Regexp::Raw.new('hello$', 's')   
  # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x0000555f51441640 @pattern="hello$", @options="s">

Compiling this regular expression produces a Ruby regular expression that
matches strings containing "hello" before a newline, besides strings ending in
"hello":

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Regexp::Raw.new('hello$', 's').compile =~ "hello\nworld"
  # => 0

This is because the meaning of ``$`` is different between PCRE and Ruby
regular expressions.

Defaults
********

You can tell a field in Mongoid to always have a default value if nothing has been provided.
Defaults are either static values or lambdas/procs.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :blood_alcohol_level, type: Float, default: 0.40
     field :last_drink, type: Time, default: ->{ 10.minutes.ago }
   end

Be wary that default values that are not defined as lambdas or procs are evaluated
at class load time, so the following 2 definitions are not equivalent.
(One would probably prefer the second, which is evaluated at document creation time.)

.. code-block:: ruby

   field :dob, type: Time, default: Time.now
   field :dob, type: Time, default: ->{ Time.now }

If you want to set a default with a dependency on the document's state, self inside a lambda
or proc evaluates to the document instance.

.. code-block:: ruby

   field :intoxicated_at, type: Time, default: ->{ new_record? ? 2.hours.ago : Time.now }

When defining a default value as a proc, Mongoid will apply the default after all other
attributes are set. If you want this to happen before the other attributes, set ``pre_processed: true``.

Aliasing Fields
***************

One of the drawbacks of having a schemaless database is that MongoDB must store all field
information along with every document, meaning that it takes up a lot of storage space in RAM
and on disk. A common pattern to limit this is to alias fields to a small number of characters,
while keeping the domain in the application expressive. Mongoid allows you to do this and
reference the fields in the domain via their long names in getters, setters, and criteria while
performing the conversion for you.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :n, as: :name, type: String
   end

   band = Band.new(name: "Placebo")
   band.attributes # { "n" => "Placebo" }

   criteria = Band.where(name: "Placebo")
   criteria.selector # { "n" => "Placebo" }

Custom Fields
*************

You can define custom types in Mongoid and determine how they are serialized and deserialized.
You simply need to provide three methods on it for Mongoid to call to convert your object to
and from MongoDB friendly values.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Profile
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :location, type: Point
   end

   class Point

     attr_reader :x, :y

     def initialize(x, y)
       @x, @y = x, y
     end

     # Converts an object of this instance into a database friendly value.
     def mongoize
       [ x, y ]
     end

     class << self

       # Get the object as it was stored in the database, and instantiate
       # this custom class from it.
       def demongoize(object)
         Point.new(object[0], object[1])
       end

       # Takes any possible object and converts it to how it would be
       # stored in the database.
       def mongoize(object)
         case object
         when Point then object.mongoize
         when Hash then Point.new(object[:x], object[:y]).mongoize
         else object
         end
       end

       # Converts the object that was supplied to a criteria and converts it
       # into a database friendly form.
       def evolve(object)
         case object
         when Point then object.mongoize
         else object
         end
       end
     end
   end

The instance method ``mongoize`` takes an instance of your object, and converts it
into how it will be stored in the database. In our example above, we want to store our
point object as an array in the form ``[ x, y ]``.

The class method ``demongoize`` takes an object as how it was stored in the database,
and is responsible for instantiating an object of your custom type. In this case, we
take an array and instantiate a ``Point`` from it.

The class method ``mongoize`` takes an object that you would use to set on your model
from your application code, and create the object as it would be stored in the database.
This is for cases where you are not passing your model instances of your custom type in the setter:

.. code-block:: ruby

   point = Point.new(12, 24)
   venue = Venue.new(location: point) # This uses the mongoize instance method.
   venue = Venue.new(location: [ 12, 24 ]) # This uses the mongoize class method.

The class method ``evolve`` takes an object, and determines how it is to be transformed
for use in criteria. For example we may want to write a query like so:

.. code-block:: ruby

   point = Point.new(12, 24)
   Venue.where(location: point)

Note that when accessing custom fields from the document, you will get a new instance
of that object with each call to the getter. This is because Mongoid is generating a new
object from the raw attributes on each access.

We need the point object in the criteria to be transformed to a Mongo friendly value when
it is not as well, ``evolve`` is the method that takes care of this. We check if the passed
in object is a ``Point`` first, in case we also want to be able to pass in ordinary arrays instead.

Reserved Names
**************

If you define a field on your document that conflicts with a reserved method name in Mongoid,
the configuration will raise an error. For a list of these you may look at
``Mongoid.destructive_fields``.

Custom Ids
**********

For cases when you do not want to have ``BSON::ObjectId`` ids, you can override Mongoid's
``_id`` field and set them to whatever you like.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :name, type: String
     field :_id, type: String, default: ->{ name }
   end

Dynamic Fields
--------------

By default, Mongoid requires all fields that may be set on a document to
be explicitly defined using ``field`` declarations. Mongoid also supports
creating fields on the fly from an arbitrary hash or documents stored in
the database. When a model uses fields not explicitly defined, such fields
are called *dynamic fields*.

To enable dynamic fields, include ``Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic`` module
in the model:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic
  end
  
  bob = Person.new(name: 'Bob', age: 42)
  bob.name
  # => "Bob"

It is possible to use ``field`` declarations and dynamic fields in the same
model class. Attributes for which there is a ``field`` declaration will be
treated according to the ``field`` declaration, with remaining attributes
being treated as dynamic fields.

Attribute values in the dynamic fields must initially be set by either
passing the attribute hash to the constructor, mass assignment via
``attributes=``, mass assignment via ``[]=``, using ``write_attribute``,
or they must already be present in the database.

.. code-block:: ruby
  
  # OK
  bob = Person.new(name: 'Bob')
  
  # OK
  bob = Person.new
  bob.attributes = {age: 42}
  
  # OK
  bob = Person.new
  bob['age'] = 42
  
  # Raises NoMethodError: undefined method age=
  bob = Person.new
  bob.age = 42
  
  # OK
  bob = Person.new
  # OK - string access
  bob.write_attribute('age', 42)
  # OK - symbol access
  bob.write_attribute(:name, 'Bob')
  
  # OK, initializes attributes from whatever is in the database
  bob = Person.find('123')

If an attribute is not present in a particular model instance's attributes
hash, both the reader and the writer for the corresponding field are not
defined, and invoking them raises ``NoMethodError``:

.. code-block:: ruby
  
  bob = Person.new
  bob.attributes = {age: 42}
  
  bob.age
  # => 42
  
  # raises NoMethodError
  bob.name
  
  # raises NoMethodError
  bob.name = 'Bob'
  
  # OK
  bob['name'] = 'Bob'
  
  bob.name
  # => "Bob"

Attributes can always be read using mass attribute access or ``read_attribute``
(this appies to models not using dynamic fields as well):

.. code-block:: ruby

  bob = Person.new(age: 42)
  
  # OK - string access
  bob['name']
  # => nil
  
  # OK - symbol access
  bob[:name]
  # => nil
  
  # OK - string access
  bob['age']
  # => 42
  
  # OK - symbol access
  bob[:age]
  # => 42
  
  # OK
  bob.attributes['name']
  # => nil
  
  # OK
  bob.attributes['age']
  # => 42
  
  # Returns nil - keys are always strings
  bob.attributes[:age]
  # => nil
  
  # OK
  bob.read_attribute('name')
  # => nil
  
  # OK
  bob.read_attribute(:name)
  # => nil
  
  # OK - string access
  bob.read_attribute('age')
  # => 42
  
  # OK - symbol access
  bob.read_attribute(:age)
  # => 42


Special Characters in Field Names
*********************************

Mongoid permits dynamic field names to include spaces and punctuation:

.. code-block:: ruby

  bob = Person.new('hello world' => 'MDB')
  bob.send('hello world')
  # => "MDB"
  
  bob.write_attribute("hello%world", 'MDB')
  bob[:"hello%world"]
  # => "MDB"


Localized Fields
----------------

Mongoid supports localized fields via `i18n <https://github.com/ruby-i18n/i18n>`_.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Product
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :description, localize: true
   end

By telling the field to ``localize``, Mongoid will under the covers store the field
as a hash of locale/value pairs, but normal access to it will behave like a string.

.. code-block:: ruby

   I18n.default_locale = :en
   product = Product.new
   product.description = "Marvelous!"
   I18n.locale = :de
   product.description = "Fantastisch!"

   product.attributes
   # { "description" => { "en" => "Marvelous!", "de" => "Fantastisch!" }

You can get and set all the translations at once by using the corresponding ``_translations`` method.

.. code-block:: ruby

   product.description_translations
   # { "en" => "Marvelous!", "de" => "Fantastisch!" }
   product.description_translations =
     { "en" => "Marvelous!", "de" => "Wunderbar!" }

Fallbacks
*********

When using fallbacks, Mongoid will automatically use them when a translation is not available.

For Rails applications, set the fallbacks configuration setting to true in your environment.

.. code-block:: ruby

   config.i18n.fallbacks = true

For non-Rails applications, you must include the fallbacks module straight to the I18n gem.

.. code-block:: ruby

   require "i18n/backend/fallbacks"
   I18n::Backend::Simple.send(:include, I18n::Backend::Fallbacks)

When the fallbacks are defined, if a translation is not present, Mongoid will fallback
in order of the defined locales.

.. code-block:: ruby

   I18n.default_locale = :en
   I18n.fallbacks = true
   ::I18n.fallbacks[:de] = [ :de, :en, :es ]
   product = Product.new
   product.description = "Marvelous!"
   I18n.locale = :de
   product.description # "Marvelous!"

Querying
********

When querying for localized fields using Mongoid's criteria API, Mongoid will automatically
alter the criteria to match the current locale.

.. code-block:: ruby

   # Match all products with Marvelous as the description. Locale is en.
   Product.where(description: "Marvelous!")
   # The resulting MongoDB query filter: { "description.en" : "Marvelous!" }

Indexing
********

If you plan to be querying extensively on localized fields, you should index each of the
locales that you plan on searching on.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Product
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :description, localize: true

     index "description.de" => 1
     index "description.en" => 1
   end

Dirty Tracking
--------------

Mongoid supports tracking of changed or "dirty" fields with an API that mirrors that of
Active Model. If a defined field has been modified in a model the model will be marked as
dirty and some additional behavior comes into play.

Viewing Changes
***************

There are various ways to view what has been altered on a model. Changes are recorded
from the time a document is instantiated, either as a new document or via loading from
the database up to the time it is saved. Any persistence operation clears the changes.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :name, type: String
   end

   person = Person.first
   person.name = "Alan Garner"

   # Check to see if the document has changed.
   person.changed? # true

   # Get an array of the names of the changed fields.
   person.changed # [ :name ]

   # Get a hash of the old and changed values for each field.
   person.changes # { "name" => [ "Alan Parsons", "Alan Garner" ] }

   # Check if a specific field has changed.
   person.name_changed? # true

   # Get the changes for a specific field.
   person.name_change # [ "Alan Parsons", "Alan Garner" ]

   # Get the previous value for a field.
   person.name_was # "Alan Parsons"

Resetting Changes
*****************

You can reset changes of a field to its previous value by calling the reset method.

.. code-block:: ruby

   person = Person.first
   person.name = "Alan Garner"

   # Reset the changed name back to the original
   person.reset_name!
   person.name # "Alan Parsons"

Notes On Persistence
********************

Mongoid uses dirty tracking as the core of its persistence operations. It looks at the
changes on a document and atomically updates only what has changed, unlike other frameworks
that write the entire document on each save. If no changes have been made, Mongoid will
not hit the database on a call to ``Model#save``.

Viewing Previous Changes
************************

After a document has been persisted, you can see what the changes were previously by
calling ``Model#previous_changes``.

.. code-block:: ruby

   person = Person.first
   person.name = "Alan Garner"
   person.save # Clears out current changes.

   # View the previous changes.
   person.previous_changes # { "name" => [ "Alan Parsons", "Alan Garner" ] }

Readonly Attributes
-------------------

You can tell Mongoid that certain attributes are readonly. This will allow documents to be
created with these attributes, but changes to them will be filtered out.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :name, type: String
     field :origin, type: String

     attr_readonly :name, :origin
   end

   band = Band.create(name: "Placebo")
   band.update_attributes(name: "Tool") # Filters out the name change.

If you explicitly try to update or remove the attribute by itself, then a ``ReadonlyAttribute``
error will be raised.

.. code-block:: ruby

   band.update_attribute(:name, "Tool") # Raises the error.
   band.remove_attribute(:name) # Raises the error.

Inheritance
-----------

Mongoid supports inheritance in both root and embedded documents. In scenarios where
documents are inherited from their fields, relations, validations and scopes get copied
down into their child documents, but not vise-versa.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Canvas
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :name, type: String
     embeds_many :shapes
   end

   class Browser < Canvas
     field :version, type: Integer
     scope :recent, ->{ where(:version.gt => 3) }
   end

   class Firefox < Browser
   end

   class Shape
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :x, type: Integer
     field :y, type: Integer
     embedded_in :canvas
   end

   class Circle < Shape
     field :radius, type: Float
   end

   class Rectangle < Shape
     field :width, type: Float
     field :height, type: Float
   end

In the above example, ``Canvas``, ``Browser`` and ``Firefox`` will all save in the canvases
collection. An additional attribute ``_type`` is stored in order to make sure when loaded
from the database the correct document is returned. This also holds true for the embedded
documents ``Circle``, ``Rectangle``, and ``Shape``.

Querying Subclasses
*******************

Querying for subclasses is handled in the normal manner, and although the documents are
all in the same collection, queries will only return documents of the correct type,
similar to Single Table Inheritance in ActiveRecord.

.. code-block:: ruby

   # Returns Canvas documents and subclasses
   Canvas.where(name: "Paper")
   # Returns only Firefox documents
   Firefox.where(name: "Window 1")

Associations
************

You can add any type of subclass to a has one or has many association, through either normal
setting or through the build and create methods on the association:

.. code-block:: ruby

   firefox = Firefox.new
   # Builds a Shape object
   firefox.shapes.build({ x: 0, y: 0 })
   # Builds a Circle object
   firefox.shapes.build({ x: 0, y: 0 }, Circle)
   # Creates a Rectangle object
   firefox.shapes.create({ x: 0, y: 0 }, Rectangle)

   rect = Rectangle.new(width: 100, height: 200)
   firefox.shapes


Timestamping
------------

Mongoid supplies a timestamping module in ``Mongoid::Timestamps`` which
can be included to get basic behavior for ``created_at`` and
``updated_at`` fields.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     include Mongoid::Timestamps
   end

You may also choose to only have specific timestamps for creation or
modification.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     include Mongoid::Timestamps::Created
   end

   class Post
     include Mongoid::Document
     include Mongoid::Timestamps::Updated
   end

If you want to turn off timestamping for specific calls, use the timeless
method:

.. code-block:: ruby

   person.timeless.save
   Person.timeless.create!

If you'd like shorter timestamp fields with aliases on them to save space,
you can include the short versions of the modules.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     include Mongoid::Timestamps::Short # For c_at and u_at.
   end

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     include Mongoid::Timestamps::Created::Short # For c_at only.
   end

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     include Mongoid::Timestamps::Updated::Short # For u_at only.
   end
