Mongoid includes ``ActiveModel::Validations`` to supply the basic
validation plus an additional associated and uniqueness validator.

See the `Active Record Validations
<https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html>`_
Rails guide and `ActiveModel::Validations
<https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Validations.html>`_ 
documentation for more information.

Mongoid behaves slightly different to Active Record when using ``#valid?``
on already persisted data. Active Record's ``#valid?`` will run all
validations whereas Mongoid's ``#valid?`` will only run validations on
documents that are in memory as an optimization.
