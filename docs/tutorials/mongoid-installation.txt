Install the Gem
---------------

Mongoid is bundled as a gem, and is hosted on `Rubygems <http://rubygems.org>`_.
It can be installed manually or with bundler.

To install the gem manually:

.. code-block:: sh

    gem install mongoid

To install the gem with bundler, include the following in your Gemfile:

.. code-block:: ruby

   gem 'mongoid', '~> 6.1.0'

Compatibility
-------------

Note the following compatibility matrix to determine if Mongoid is
supported on your runtime and server. Note that Mongoid 6.x is compatible with
Rails 5 and thus requires >= Ruby 2.2.2.

Configuration
-------------

Mongoid configuration can be done through a ``mongoid.yml`` that specifies your
options and clients. The simplest configuration is as follows, which sets the default
client to "localhost:27017" and provides a single database in that client named "mongoid".

.. code-block:: yaml

  development:
    clients:
      default:
        database: mongoid
        hosts:
          - localhost:27017

Rails Applications
******************

You can generate a config file by executing the generator and then editing
``myapp/config/mongoid.yml`` to your heart's desire. Mongoid will then handle
everything else from there.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ rails g mongoid:config

When Mongoid loads its configuration, it chooses the environment to use based
on the following order:

- ``Rails.env`` if using Rails.
- ``Sinatra::Base.environment`` if using Sinatra.
- ``RACK_ENV`` environment variable.
- ``MONGOID_ENV`` environment variable.

If you are not using any rack based application and want to override the
environment programatically, you can pass a second paramter to ``load!`` and
Mongoid will use that.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongoid.load!("path/to/your/mongoid.yml", :production)

Depending on your version of Rails, you may also need to configure the orm to be Mongoid in application.rb.

.. code-block:: ruby

  config.generators do |g|
    g.orm :mongoid
  end

Anatomy of a Mongoid Config
***************************

Let's have a look at a full-blown ``mongoid.yml`` and explain the full power
of what Mongoid can do. The following configuration has its explanation in the
comments above each key.

.. code-block:: yaml

  development:
    # Configure available database clients. (required)
    clients:
      # Define the default client. (required)
      default:
        # A uri may be defined for a client:
        # uri: 'mongodb://user:password@myhost1.mydomain.com:27017/my_db'
        # Please see driver documentation for details. Alternatively, you can define the following:
        #
        # Define the name of the default database that Mongoid can connect to.
        # (required).
        database: my_db
        # Provide the hosts the default client can connect to. Must be an array
        # of host:port pairs. (required)
        hosts:
          - myhost1.mydomain.com:27017
          - myhost2.mydomain.com:27017
          - myhost3.mydomain.com:27017
        options:
          # Change the default write concern. (default = { w: 1 })
          write:
            w: 1

          # Change the default read preference. Valid options for mode are: :secondary,
          # :secondary_preferred, :primary, :primary_preferred, :nearest
          # (default: primary)
          read:

          roles:

          # Change the default authentication mechanism. Valid options are: :scram,
          # :mongodb_cr, :mongodb_x509, and :plain. (default on 3.0 is :scram, default

          # to be checked in before timing out. (default: 1)
          wait_queue_timeout: 1

          # The time to wait to establish a connection before timing out, in seconds.
          # (default: 10)
          connect_timeout: 10

          # The timeout to wait to execute operations on a socket before raising an error.
          # (default: 5)
          socket_timeout: 5

          # The name of the replica set to connect to. Servers provided as seeds that do
          # not belong to this replica set will be ignored.

          ssl: true

          # The certificate file used to identify the connection against MongoDB.
          ssl_cert: /path/to/my.cert

          # The private keyfile used to identify the connection against MongoDB.
          # Note that even if the key is stored in the same file as the certificate,
          # both need to be explicitly specified.
          ssl_key: /path/to/my.key

          # A passphrase for the private key.
          ssl_key_pass_phrase: password

          # Whether or not to do peer certification validation. (default: true)
          ssl_verify: true

          # The file containing a set of concatenated certification authority certifications
          # used to validate certs passed from the other end of the connection.
          ssl_ca_cert: /path/to/ca.cert

      use_utc: false

      # Set the Mongoid and Ruby driver log levels. (default: :info)

Logging
*******

Changing logging options is done simply by telling Mongoid or the driver's logger to have
a different level. Logging level is ``DEBUG`` by default.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongoid.logger.level = Logger::DEBUG
  Mongo::Logger.logger.level = Logger::DEBUG
