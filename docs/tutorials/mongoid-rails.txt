Mongoid was built and targeted towards Rails applications, even though it will
work in any Ruby application. This document explains how
to use Mongoid with a Rails application.

Using Mongoid with a new Rails application
------------------------------------------

If you are creating a new Rails application, you'll have to use the ``--skip-active-record``
flag with ``rails new``.

Using Mongoid with an existing Rails application
------------------------------------------------

If you're starting to use an existing Rails application with Mongoid, you'll have to update your
``config/application.rb`` file to remove the ``require 'rails/all'`` line and only include the
frameworks you want. You must also ensure that you remove all references to ActiveRecord in the
``config`` directory and ``models`` directory.

Railties
--------

Mongoid provides some railties and initializers that one should be aware of when writing
a Rails application with Mongoid.

Configuration
*************

You can set Mongoid configuration options in your application.rb along with other Rails
environment specific options by accessing config.mongoid. Options set here will override
those set in your ``config/mongoid.yml``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  module MyApplication
    class Application < Rails::Application
      config.mongoid.logger = Logger.new($stdout, :warn)
    end
  end

Model Preloading
****************

In order to properly set up single collection inheritance, Mongoid needs to preload all
models before every request in development mode. This can get slow, so if you are not
using any inheritance it is recommended you turn this feature off.

.. code-block:: ruby

  config.mongoid.preload_models = false

Exceptions
**********

Similar to Active Record, Mongoid tells raise to return specific http codes when some errors are raised.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound : 404
  Mongoid::Errors::Validations : 422

Rake Tasks
----------

Mongoid provides the following rake tasks when used in a Rails 3 environment:

- ``db:create``: Exists only for dependency purposes, does not actually do anything.
- ``db:create_indexes``: Reads all index definitions from the models and attempts to create them in the database.
- ``db:remove_indexes``: Reads all secondary index definitions from the models.
- ``db:drop``: Drops all collections in the database with the exception of the system collections.
- ``db:migrate``: Exists only for dependency purposes, does not actually do anything.
- ``db:purge``: Deletes all data, including indexes, from the database. Since 3.1.0
- ``db:schema:load``: Exists only for framework dependency purposes, does not actually do anything.
- ``db:seed``: Seeds the database from db/seeds.rb
- ``db:setup``: Creates indexes and seeds the database.
- ``db:test:prepare``: Exists only for framework dependency purposes, does not actually do anything.
