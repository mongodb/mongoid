Upgrading to Mongoid 7.2
========================

The following sections describe major changes in Mongoid 7.2.

Shard Key Used For Reloading
----------------------------

Minor change: When sharding is used, Mongoid 7.2 expects the shard key declared
in models to match the shard key in the database for the respective collections.
In Mongoid 7.2 model reloading (either explicit via the ``reload`` method
or implicit as part of persistence operations) uses the shard key, if one is
defined, in the ``find`` command in addition to the ``id`` field value.
This improves the performance of document reloading, and consequently some
persistence operations, in sharded clusters, especially those with
`geographically distributed shards
<https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/global-clusters/>`_.

Consider a class ``Band`` whose documents are sharded by the ``name`` key.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String

    shard_key :name
  end

Example Mongoid 7.2 behavior:

.. code-block:: ruby

  band = Band.create(name: "Destiny's Child")
  band.reload
  # Command logs: { "find"=>"bands", "filter"=>{ "_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('...') "name"=>"Destiny's Child" } }

Example Mongoid 7.1 behavior:

.. code-block:: ruby

  band = Band.create(name: "Destiny's Child")
  band.reload
  # Command logs: { "find"=>"bands", "filter"=>{"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('...') } }

Mongoid provides :ref:`sharding management Rake tasks <sharding-management>`
to shard collections according to shard keys declared in models.


Upgrading to Mongoid 7.1
========================

The following sections describe major changes in Mongoid 7.1.

Condition Combination
---------------------

**Breaking change:** In Mongoid 7.1, when condition methods are invoked on a
Criteria object, they always add new conditions to the existing conditions in
the Criteria object. Previously new conditions could have replaced existing
conditions in some circumstances.

Example Mongoid 7.1 behavior:

.. code-block:: ruby

    Band.where(id: 1).where(id: 2)
    # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    #   selector: {"_id"=>1, "$and"=>[{"_id"=>2}]}
    #   options:  {}
    #   class:    Band
    #   embedded: false>

Corresponding Mongoid 7.0 behavior:

.. code-block:: ruby

    Band.where(id: 1).where(id: 2)
    # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    #   selector: {"_id"=>2}
    #   options:  {}
    #   class:    Band
    #   embedded: false>

Logical Operations
------------------

**Breaking change:** In Mongoid 7.1 logical operator methods ``or`` and
``nor`` treat the receiver as one of the operands. This behavior matches that
of ActiveRecord. Previously, ``or`` and ``nor`` added their parameters as
additional conditions to the receiver.

Example Mongoid 7.1 behavior:

.. code-block:: ruby

    Band.where(name: 'One').or(name: 'Two')
    # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    #   selector: {"$or"=>[{"name"=>"One"}, {"name"=>"Two"}]}
    #   options:  {}
    #   class:    Band
    #   embedded: false>

Corresponding Mongoid 7.0 behavior:

.. code-block:: ruby

    Band.where(name: 'One').or(name: 'Two')
    # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    #   selector: {"name"=>"One", "$or"=>[{"name"=>"Two"}]}
    #   options:  {}
    #   class:    Band
    #   embedded: false>

To add ``or`` or ``nor`` parameters to the existing query without disjuncting
the existing query, create a separate scope:

.. code-block:: ruby

    Band.where(name: 'One').and(Band.or({name: 'Two'}, {name: 'Three'}))
    # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    #   selector: {"name"=>"One", "$and"=>[{"$or"=>[{"name"=>"Two"}, {"name"=>"Three"}]}]}
    #   options:  {}
    #   class:    Band
    #   embedded: false>

Alternatively, use ``any_of`` which behaves as ``or`` did in Mongoid 7.0:

.. code-block:: ruby

    Band.where(name: 'One').any_of({name: 'Two'}, {name: 'Three'})
    # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    #   selector: {"name"=>"One", "$or"=>[{"name"=>"Two"}, {"name"=>"Three"}]}
    #   options:  {}
    #   class:    Band
    #   embedded: false>

For more information, please review the :ref:`logical operations
<logical-operations>` section of the documentation.

Merge Strategies
----------------

**Breaking change:** In Mongoid 7.1, :ref:`Merge strategies <merge-strategies>`
must be explicitly requested. Previously, ``all`` defaulted to the
union strategy and ``in`` and ``nin`` defaulted to the intersect strategy.
In Mongoid 7.1, there is no merge strategy applied by default.

Example Mongoid 7.1 behavior:

.. code-block:: ruby

    Band.all(a: 1).all(a: 2)
    # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    #   selector: {"a"=>{"$all"=>[1]}, "$and"=>[{"a"=>{"$all"=>[2]}}]}
    #   options:  {}
    #   class:    Band
    #   embedded: false>

Default Mongoid 7.0 behavior:

.. code-block:: ruby

    Band.all(a: 1).all(a: 2)
    # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    #   selector: {"a"=>{"$all"=>[1, 2]}}
    #   options:  {}
    #   class:    Band
    #   embedded: false>

To achieve the same behavior in Mongoid 7.1, the desired merge strategy must be
explicitly requested:

.. code-block:: ruby

    Band.all(a: 1).union.all(a: 2)
    # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    #   selector: {"a"=>{"$all"=>[1, 2]}}
    #   options:  {}
    #   class:    Band
    #   embedded: false>

Required Condition Arguments
----------------------------

**Breaking change:** ``nil`` arguments to Criteria methods are no longer
accepted. For example, the following invocation is now an error:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.where(nil)

**Breaking change:** Most Criteria methods (other than logical operations)
can no longer be called without arguments. For example, the following
invocation is now an error:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.in

``and``, ``or``, ``nor``, ``not``, ``any_of`` and ``where`` can be called
without arguments.

Generated Queries
-----------------

Minor change: Mongoid 7.1 will simplify the Criteria selectors where possible
by eliding unnecessary logical operators, typically ``$and``.

Example Mongoid 7.1 behavior:

.. code-block:: ruby

    Band.where(year: 2000).and(name: 'One')
    # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    #   selector: {"year"=>2000, "name"=>"One"}
    #   options:  {}
    #   class:    Band
    #   embedded: false>

Corresponding Mongoid 7.0 behavior:

.. code-block:: ruby

    Band.where(year: 2000).and(name: 'One')
    # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    #   selector: {"year"=>2000, "$and"=>[{"name"=>"One"}]}
    #   options:  {}
    #   class:    Band
    #   embedded: false>

Mongoid 7.1 also takes steps to produce the same selector shapes when
semantically the same query is constructed using different code paths. For
example, the following two approaches result in the same generated selector:

.. code-block:: ruby

    Band.where(name: /ne/).and(name: 'One')

    Band.and({name: /ne/}, {name: 'One'})

    # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    #   selector: {"name"=>/ne/, "$and"=>[{"name"=>"One"}]}
    #   options:  {}
    #   class:    Band
    #   embedded: false>


Ruby Version Support
--------------------

As of version 7.1, Mongoid supports Ruby 2.3+ and JRuby 9.2.
Support for Ruby 2.2 and JRuby 9.1 has been dropped.

Changes in Mongoid 7.1.0
------------------------

Improvement: :ref:`Multiple atomic operations can now be grouped
<atomic-operation-grouping>` to be executed as a single atomic operation.

Improvement: :ref:`Shard key declarations <shard-keys>` now support hashed
shard keys, and a Rake task to shard collection has been added to the
:ref:`sharding management Rake tasks <sharding-management>`.

Changes in Mongoid 7.1.1
------------------------

**Breaking change:** The behavior of :ref:`any_of <any-of>` was reverted to
its Mongoid 7.0 behavior. As was the case in Mongoid 7.0, ``any_of`` now
does not treat the receiver as one of its operands:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.where(year: 1990).any_of({name: 'One'}, {name: 'Two'})
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {"year"=>1990, "$or"=>[{"name"=>"One"}, {"name"=>"Two"}]}
  #   options:  {}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>

``or`` behaves the same way in Mongoid 7.1.1 and 7.1.0:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.where(year: 1990).or({name: 'One'}, {name: 'Two'})
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {"$or"=>[{"year"=>1990}, {"name"=>"One"}, {"name"=>"Two"}]}
  #   options:  {}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>

Minor change: The value of ``include_root_in_json`` is now properly respected
throughout the model hierarchy. Previously the values set on model classes
were ignored.

Improvement: ``Model.where`` can now be called with no arguments.

Improvement: Polymorphic ``belongs_to`` associations can now be eagerly loaded.


Upgrading to Mongoid 7.0
========================

Significant improvements and changes in Mongoid 7.0 are listed below.
Please note that improvements that have been backported to Mongoid 6.x are
not included in this list.

The behavior of :ref:`read-only attributes <read-only>` now matches that of
ActiveRecord.

Referenced associations now support all :ref:`dependent behaviors <dependent-behavior>`
that `ActiveRecord supports <http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html>`_.

:ref:`$unwind <unwind-dsl>` operator support added to the :ref:`aggregation
pipeline builder DSL <aggregation-pipeline-builder-dsl>`.

``background_indexing`` Mongoid :ref:`configuration option
<configuration-options>` added.

Mongoid 7.0 requires MongoDB server 2.6 or newer, Ruby 2.2.2 or higher and
supports Rails 5.1-6.0.

New in version 7.0.3: Embedded matchers now support the ``$eq`` operator.

New in version 7.0.5: Mongoid now officially supports Rails 6.0.


Upgrading to Mongoid 6
======================

Mongoid 6 is compatible with Rails 5 and requires Ruby 2.2.2 or higher.

Please see the list of behavior changes for version
`6.0.0.rc0 <https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid/releases/tag/v6.0.0.rc0>`_
and version
`6.0.0.beta <https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid/releases/tag/v6.0.0.beta>`_
for specific changes that might be required in your code.


Upgrading to Mongoid 5
======================

The underlying driver has changed from Moped to the official MongoDB Ruby driver.
For all users dropping down to the driver level for operations, please see the driver
documentation for help with that API.

All Mongoid configuration options have changed, as the underlying driver has changed
from Moped to the official MongoDB Ruby driver. Please see the
:ref:`configuration section <mongoid-configuration>` for a detailed description
of all the new options.

All references to session are now replaced with client. This includes the ``mongoid.yml``
configuration, ``store_in`` options, and all exceptions and modules with Session in the name.

``find_and_modify`` has been removed and replaced with 3 options: ``find_one_and_update``,
``find_one_and_delete`` and ``find_one_and_replace``.

``text_search`` has been removed as it is now a $text option in a query from
MongoDB 2.6 onward.

``first`` and ``last`` no longer add an ``_id`` sort when no sorting options have been
provided. In order to guarantee that a document is the first or last, it needs to now
contain an explicit sort.

Mongoid 5 supports MongoDB 2.4 and higher only - MongoDB 2.2 is no longer
supported.
