Referenced Associations
-----------------------

Mongoid supports the ``has_one``, ``has_many``, ``belongs_to`` and
``has_and_belongs_to_many`` associations familiar to ActiveRecord users.


Has One
*******

One to one associations where documents are stored in separate collections
are defined using ``has_one`` and ``belongs_to`` macros.

Defining
~~~~~~~~

The parent document of the association should use the ``has_one`` macro to
indicate is has one referenced child, and the document that is referenced
should use ``belongs_to``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_one :studio
  end

  class Studio
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    belongs_to :band
  end

Definitions are required on both sides to the association in order for it to
work properly.

Storage
~~~~~~~

When defining an association of this nature, each document is stored in its
respective collection, and the child document contains a "foreign key"
reference to the parent:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # The parent band document.
  { "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9") }

  # The child studio document.
  {
    "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7f1"),
    "band_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9")
  }


Has Many
********

One to many associations where the children are stored in a separate
collection from the parent document are defined using Mongoid's ``has_many``
and ``belongs_to`` macros.

Defining
~~~~~~~~

The parent document of the association should use the ``has_many`` macro to
indicate is has n number of referenced children, where the document that is
referenced uses ``belongs_to``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_many :members
  end

  class Member
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    belongs_to :band
  end

Definitions are required on both sides to the association in order for it
to work properly.

Storage
~~~~~~~

When defining an association of this nature, each document is stored in its
respective collection, and the child document contains a "foreign key"
reference to the parent.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # The parent band document.
  { "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9") }

  # A child member document.
  {
    "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7f1"),
    "band_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9")
  }

Belongs To
**********

A ``belongs_to`` macro is used when a document is the child in a ``has_one``
or ``has_many`` association. By default, in order for a document to
be saved, each of its ``belongs_to`` associations must be provided a value.
To override this requirement, you can use the option ``optional: false``
on the ``belong_to`` association.

Defining
~~~~~~~~

The child document of the association uses the ``belongs_to`` macro to indicate
it is associated with a parent. The document on the ``belongs_to`` side
stores the reference to the parent.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_one :studio
  end

  class Studio
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    belongs_to :band
  end

Definitions are required on both sides to the association in order for it to
work properly.

Storage
~~~~~~~

When defining an association of this nature, each document is stored in its respective collection,
but the child document contains a "foreign key" reference to the parent.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # The parent band document.
  { "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9") }

  # The child studio document.
  {
    "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7f1"),
    "band_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9")
  }

Has And Belongs To Many
***********************

Many to many associations in Mongoid are defined using the
``has_and_belongs_to_many`` macro. Unlike ActiveRecord's
``has_and_belongs_to_many``, in Mongoid there is no "join collection" -
the foreign key ids are stored as arrays on both sides of the association.

``has_and_belongs_to_many`` association has no embedded equivalent.

Defining
~~~~~~~~

Both sides of the association use the same macro.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_and_belongs_to_many :tags
  end

  class Tag
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    has_and_belongs_to_many :bands
  end

You can create a one sided many to many if you want to mimic a has_many
that stores the keys as an array on the parent.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_and_belongs_to_many :tags, inverse_of: nil
  end

  class Tag
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
  end

Storage
~~~~~~~

When defining an association of this nature, each document is stored in its
respective collection, and each document contains a "foreign key" reference
to the other in the form of an array.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # The band document.
  {
    "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9"),
    "tag_ids" : [ ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7f2") ]
  }

  # The tag document.
  {
    "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7f2"),
    "band_ids" : [ ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9") ]
  }

Embedded Associations
---------------------

Thanks to MongoDB's document model, Mongoid also offers embedded associations
which allow documents of different types to be stored hierarchically
in the same collection. Embedded associations are defined using
``embeds_one``, ``embeds_many`` and ``embedded_in`` macros, plus
``recursively_embeds_one`` and ``recursively_embeds_many``for recursive
embedding.

Embeds One
**********

One to one associations where the children are embedded in the parent
document are defined using Mongoid's ``embeds_one`` and ``embedded_in`` macros.

Defining
~~~~~~~~

The parent document of the association should use the ``embeds_one`` macro to
indicate is has one embedded child, where the document that is embedded uses
``embedded_in``. Definitions are required on both sides to the association
in order for it to work properly.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     embeds_one :label
   end
  
   class Label
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :name, type: String
     embedded_in :band
   end

Storage
~~~~~~~

Documents that are embedded using the ``embeds_one`` macro are stored as a
hash inside the parent in the parent's database collection.

.. code-block:: ruby

  {
    "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9"),
    "label" : {
      "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e0"),
      "name" : "Mute",
    }
  }

You can optionally tell Mongoid to store the embedded document in a different
attribute other than the name, by providing the ``:store_as`` option.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    embeds_one :label, store_as: "lab"
  end


Embeds Many
***********

One to many relationships where the children are embedded in the parent
document are defined using Mongoid's ``embeds_many`` and ``embedded_in`` macros.

Defining
~~~~~~~~

The parent document of the association should use the ``embeds_many`` macro
to indicate it has many embedded children, where the document that is
embedded uses ``embedded_in``. Definitions are required on both sides of
the association in order for it to work properly.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    embeds_many :albums
  end

  class Album
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    embedded_in :band
  end

Storage
~~~~~~~

Documents that are embedded using the ``embeds_many`` macro are stored as
an array of hashes inside the parent in the parent's database collection.

.. code-block:: ruby

  {
    "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9"),
    "albums" : [
      {
        "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e0"),
        "name" : "Violator",
      }
    ]
  }

You can optionally tell Mongoid to store the embedded document in a different
attribute other than the name, by providing the ``:store_as`` option.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    embeds_many :albums, store_as: "albs"
  end

Recursive Embedding
*******************

A document can recursively embed itself using ``recursively_embeds_one`` or
``recursively_embeds_many``, which provides accessors for the parent and
children via ``parent_`` and ``child_`` methods.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Tag
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :name, type: String
     recursively_embeds_many
   end
  
   root = Tag.new(name: "programming")
   child_one = root.child_tags.build
   child_two = root.child_tags.build
  
   root.child_tags # [ child_one, child_two ]
   child_one.parent_tag # [ root ]
   child_two.parent_tag # [ root ]
  
   class Node
     include Mongoid::Document
     recursively_embeds_one
   end
  
   root = Node.new
   child = Node.new
   root.child_node = child
  
   root.child_node # child
   child.parent_node # root

Referencing Vs Embedding
************************

While a complete discussion of referencing vs embedding is beyond the scope
of this tutorial, here are some high level considerations for choosing
one over the other.

When an association is embedded, both parent and child documents are stored
in the same collection. This permits efficient persistence and retrieval
when both are used/needed. For example, if the navigation bar on a web site
shows attributes of a user that are stored in documents themselves, it is
often a good idea to use embedded associations.

Using embedded associations allows using MongoDB tools like the
`aggregation pipeline
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/>`_ to query
these documents in a powerful way.

Because embedded documents are stored as part of their parent top-level
documents, it is not possible to persist an embedded document by itself,
nor is it possible to retrieve embedded documents directly. However,
embedded documents can still be efficiently queried and retrieved with the
help of MongoDB projection operation:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :started_on, type: Date
    embeds_one :label
  end
  
  class Label
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    embedded_in :band
  end

  # Retrieve labels for bands started in the last year.
  #
  # Sends a find query like this:
  # {"find"=>"bands",
  #  "filter"=>{"started_on"=>{"$gt"=>2018-07-01 00:00:00 UTC}},
  #  "projection"=>{"_id"=>1, "label"=>1}}
  Band.where(started_on: {'$gt' => Time.now - 1.year}).only(:label).map(&:label).compact.uniq


Common Behavior
---------------

Extensions
**********

All associations can have extensions, which provides a way to add application specific
functionality to the association. They are defined by providing a block to the association definition.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     embeds_many :addresses do
       def find_by_country(country)
         where(country: country).first
       end
       def chinese
         @target.select { |address| address.country == "China" }
       end
     end
   end
  
   person.addresses.find_by_country("Mongolia") # returns address
   person.addresses.chinese # returns [ address ]

Custom Association Names
************************

You can name your associations whatever you like, but if the class cannot be inferred by
Mongoid from the name, and neither can the opposite side you'll want to provide the
macro with some additional options to tell Mongoid how to hook them up.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Lush
     include Mongoid::Document
     embeds_one :whiskey, class_name: "Drink", inverse_of: :alcoholic
   end
   
   class Drink
     include Mongoid::Document
     embedded_in :alcoholic, class_name: "Lush", inverse_of: :whiskey
   end

Custom Primary & Foreign Keys
*****************************

The fields used when looking up associations can be explicitly specified.
The default is to use ``id`` on the "parent" association and ``#{association_name}_id``
on the "child" association, for example with a has_many/belongs_to:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Company
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_many :emails
  end
  
  class Email
    include Mongoid::Document
    belongs_to :company
  end
  
  company = Company.find(id)
  # looks up emails where emails.company_id == company.id
  company.emails

Specify a different ``primary_key`` to change the field name on the "parent"
association and ``foreign_key`` to change the field name on the "child"
association:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Company
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :c, type: String
    has_many :emails, foreign_key: 'c_ref', primary_key: 'c'
  end

  class Email
    include Mongoid::Document
    # This definition of c_ref is automatically generated by Mongoid:
    # field :c_ref, type: Object
    # But the type can also be specified:
    field :c_ref, type: String
    belongs_to :company, foreign_key: 'c_ref', primary_key: 'c'
  end
  
  company = Company.find(id)
  # looks up emails where emails.c_ref == company.c
  company.emails

With a has_and_belongs_to_many association, since the data is stored on both
sides of the association, there are 4 fields configurable when the association
is defined:

- ``:primary_key`` is the field on the remote model that contains the value
  by which the remote model is looked up.
- ``:foreign_key`` is the field on the local model which stores the
  ``:primary_key`` values.
- ``:inverse_primary_key`` is the field on the local model that the remote
  model uses to look up the local model docuemnts.
- ``:inverse_foreign_key`` is the field on the remote model storing the
  values in ``:inverse_primary_key``.

An example might make this more clear:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Company
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    field :c_id, type: Integer
    field :e_ids, type: Array
    
    has_and_belongs_to_many :employees,
      primary_key: :e_id, foreign_key: :e_ids,
      inverse_primary_key: :c_id, inverse_foreign_key: :c_ids
  end
  
  class Employee
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    field :e_id, type: Integer
    field :c_ids, type: Array
    
    has_and_belongs_to_many :companies,
      primary_key: :c_id, foreign_key: :c_ids,
      inverse_primary_key: :e_id, inverse_foreign_key: :e_ids
  end
  
  company = Company.create!(c_id: 123)
  # => #<Company _id: 5c565ece026d7c461d8a9d4e, c_id: 123, e_ids: nil>
  
  employee = Employee.create!(e_id: 456)
  # => #<Employee _id: 5c565ee8026d7c461d8a9d4f, e_id: 456, c_ids: nil>

  company.employees << employee
  
  company
  # => #<Company _id: 5c565ece026d7c461d8a9d4e, c_id: 123, e_ids: [456]>
  
  employee
  # => #<Employee _id: 5c5883ce026d7c4b9e244c0c, e_id: 456, c_ids: [123]>

Note that just like with the default ``#{association_name}_id`` field,
Mongoid automatically adds a field for the custom foreign key ``c_ref`` to
the model. However, since Mongoid doesn't know what type of data should be
allowed in the field, the field is created with a type of Object. It is a
good idea to explicitly define the field with the appropriate type.

Validations
***********

It is important to note that by default, Mongoid will validate the children of any
association that are loaded into memory via a ``validates_associated``. The associations that
this applies to are:

- ``embeds_many``
- ``embeds_one``
- ``has_many``
- ``has_one``
- ``has_and_belongs_to_many``

If you do not want this behavior, you may turn it off when defining the association.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
   
     embeds_many :addresses, validate: false
     has_many :posts, validate: false
   end


Polymorphism
************

One to one and one to many associations support polymorphism, which is
having a single association potentially contain objects of different classes.
For example, we could model an organization in which departments and teams
have managers as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Department
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    has_one :manager, as: :unit
  end
  
  class Team
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    has_one :manager, as: :unit
  end
   
  class Manager
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    belongs_to :unit, polymorphic: true
  end
  
  dept = Department.create!
  team = Team.create!
  
  alice = Manager.create!(unit: dept)
  alice.unit == dept
  # => true
  dept.manager == alice
  # => true

To provide another example, suppose we want to track price history for
products and bundles. This can be achieved via an embedded one to many
polymorphic association:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Product
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    field :name, type: String
    has_and_belongs_to_many :bundles
    
    embeds_many :prices, as: :item
  end
  
  class Bundle
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :name, type: String
    has_and_belongs_to_many :products

    embeds_many :prices, as: :item
  end
  
  class Price
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    embedded_in :item, polymorphic: true
  end
  
  pants = Product.create!(name: 'Pants',
    prices: [Price.new, Price.new])
  costume = Bundle.create!(name: 'Costume', products: [pants],
    prices: [Price.new, Price.new])

To define a polymorphic association, specify the ``polymorphic: true`` option
on the child association and add the ``as: :association_name`` option to the
parent association.

Note that Mongoid currently supports polymorphism only in one direction - from
the child to the parent. For example, polymorphism cannot be used to specify
that a bundle may contain other bundles or products:
  
.. code-block:: ruby

  class Bundle
    include Mongoid::Document

    # Does not work:
    has_many :items, polymorphic: true
  end

``has_and_belongs_to_many`` associations do not support polymorphism.


Cascading Callbacks
*******************

If you want the embedded document callbacks to fire when calling a persistence operation on
its parent, you will need to provide the cascade callbacks option to the association.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     embeds_many :albums, cascade_callbacks: true
     embeds_one :label, cascade_callbacks: true
   end

  band.save # Fires all save callbacks on the band, albums, and label.

Dependent Behavior
******************

You can provide dependent options to referenced associations to instruct Mongoid
how to handle situations where one side of the association is deleted, or is attempted
to be deleted. The options are as follows:

- ``:delete``: Delete the child document without running any of the model callbacks.
- ``:destroy``: Destroy the child document and run all of the model callbacks.
- ``:nullify``: Orphan the child document.
- ``:restrict``: Raise an error if the child is not empty.

The default behavior of each association when no dependent option is provided is to nullify.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     has_many :albums, dependent: :delete_all
     belongs_to :label, dependent: :nullify
   end
  
   class Album
     include Mongoid::Document
     belongs_to :band
   end
  
   class Label
     include Mongoid::Document
     has_many :bands, dependent: :restrict
   end
  
   label = Label.first
   label.bands.push(Band.first)
   label.delete # Raises an error since bands is not empty.
  
   Band.first.delete # Will delete all associated albums.

Autosaving
**********

One core difference between Mongoid and Active Record from a behavior standpoint
is that Mongoid does not automatically save associated documents for
non-embedded associations. This is for performance reasons.

To enable an autosave on a non-embedded association (embedded associations do not need
this since they are actually part of the parent in the database) add the autosave
option to the association.

Note that autosave functionality will automatically be added to an association when using
``accepts_nested_attributes_for`` or validating presence of the association.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     has_many :albums, autosave: true
   end
 
   band = Band.first
   band.albums.build(name: "101")
   band.save # Will save the album as well.

Existence Predicates
********************

All associations have existence predicates on them in the form of ``name?`` and ``has_name?``
to check if the association is blank.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     embeds_one :label
     embeds_many :albums
   end
 
   band.label?
   band.has_label?
   band.albums?
   band.has_albums?

Autobuilding
************

One to one associations (``embeds_one``, ``has_one``) have an autobuild option which tells
Mongoid to instantiate a new document when the association is accessed and it is ``nil``.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     embeds_one :label, autobuild: true
     has_one :producer, autobuild: true
   end
  
   band = Band.new
   band.label # Returns a new empty label.
   band.producer # Returns a new empty producer.

Touching
********

Any ``belongs_to`` association, no matter where it hangs off from, can take an optional ``:touch``
option which will call the touch method on it and any parent associations with the option defined
when the base document calls ``#touch``.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     belongs_to :label, touch: true
   end
  
   band = Band.first
   band.touch # Calls touch on the parent label.

The counter_cache Option
************************

As with ActiveRecord, the ``:counter_cache`` option can be used on an association
to make finding the number of belonging objects more efficient. Also similar
to ActiveRecord, you must take into account that there will be an extra
attribute on the associated model. This means that with Mongoid,
you need to include ``Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic`` on the associated model.
For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Order
    include Mongoid::Document
    belongs_to :customer, counter_cache: true
  end

  class Customer
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic
    has_many :orders
  end

Association metadata
--------------------

All associations in Mongoid contain metadata that holds information about the association in
question, and is a valuable tool for third party developers to use to extend Mongoid.

You can access the association metadata of the association in a few different ways.

.. code-block:: ruby

   # Get the metadata for a named association from the class or document.
   Model.reflect_on_association(:association_name)
   model.reflect_on_association(:association_name)
 
   # Get the metadata with a specific association itself on a specific
   # document.
   model.associations[:association_name]

Attributes
**********

All associations contain a ``_target``, which is the proxied document or documents, a ``_base``
which is the document the association hangs off, and ``_association`` which provides information
about the association.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     embeds_many :addresses
   end
   
   person.addresses = [ address ]
   person.addresses._target # returns [ address ]
   person.addresses._base # returns person
   person.addresses._association # returns the association metadata

The Association Object
**********************

The association object itself contains more information than one might know what to do
with, and is useful for developers of extensions to Mongoid.

Querying Associations
---------------------

Mongoid supports several forms of efficient querying of documents based on
associations.


Embedded Associations
*********************

Given the following models:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    embeds_many :tours
    embeds_many :awards
    field :name, type: String
  end
  
  class Tour
    include Mongoid::Document
    embedded_in :band
    field :year, type: Integer
  end
  
  class Award
    include Mongoid::Document
    embedded_in :band
    field :name, type: String
  end

Mongoid allows retrieving bands whose tours have certain attributes via the
dot notation, as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Get all bands that have toured since 2000
  Band.where('tours.year' => {'$gte' => 2000})

Mongoid also can retrieve embedded documents only, without retrieving top-level
documents, using projection:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Get awards for bands that have toured since 2000
  Band.where('tours.year' => {'$gte' => 2000}).pluck(:awards)


Referenced Associations
***********************

If the associations are referenced rather than embedded, performing queries
through them takes a bit more work. Given the following models modified from
the previous example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_many :tours
    has_many :awards
    field :name, type: String
  end
  
  class Tour
    include Mongoid::Document
    belongs_to :band
    field :year, type: Integer
  end
  
  class Award
    include Mongoid::Document
    belongs_to :band
    field :name, type: String
  end

One could retrieve all bands that have toured since 2000 as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  band_ids = Tour.where(year: {'$gte' => 2000}).pluck(:band_id)
  bands = Band.find(band_ids)

The conditions on ``Tour`` can be arbitrarily complex, but they must all
be on the same ``Tour`` document (or documents embedded in ``Tour``).

To find awards for bands that have toured since 2000:

.. code-block:: ruby

  band_ids = Tour.where(year: {'$gte' => 2000}).pluck(:band_id)
  awards = Award.where(band_id: {'$in' => band_ids})


Aggregation Pipeline
********************

Mongoid exposes MongoDB's aggregation pipeline for queries involving multiple
referenced associations at the same time. Given the same setup as before with
referenced associations:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_many :tours
    has_many :awards
    field :name, type: String
  end
  
  class Tour
    include Mongoid::Document
    belongs_to :band
    field :year, type: Integer
  end
  
  class Award
    include Mongoid::Document
    belongs_to :band
    field :name, type: String
  end

To retrieve bands that toured since 2000 and have at least one award, one
could do the following:

.. code-block:: ruby

  band_ids = Band.collection.aggregate([
    {'$lookup' => {
      from: 'tours',
      localField: '_id',
      foreignField: 'band_id',
      as: 'tours',
    }},
    {'$lookup' => {
      from: 'awards',
      localField: '_id',
      foreignField: 'band_id',
      as: 'awards',
    }},
    {'$match' => {
      'tours.year' => {'$gte' => 2000},
      'awards._id' => {'$exists' => true},
    }},
    {'$project' => {_id: 1}},
  ])
  bands = Band.find(band_ids)

Note that the aggregation pipeline, since it is implemented by the Ruby driver
for MongoDB and not Mongoid, returns raw ``BSON::Document`` objects rather than
``Mongoid::Document`` model instances. The above example projects only
the ``_id`` field which is then used to load full models. An alternative is
to not perform such a projection and work with raw fields, which would eliminate
having to send the list of document ids to Mongoid in the second query
(which could be large).
