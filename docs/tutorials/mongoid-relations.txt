Common Behaviour
----------------

Attributes
**********

All relations contain a ``_target``, which is the proxied document or documents, a ``_base``
which is the document the relation hangs off, and ``_association`` which provides information
about the relation.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     embeds_many :addresses
   end
   
   person.addresses = [ address ]
   person.addresses._target # returns [ address ]
   person.addresses._base # returns person
   person.addresses._association # returns the association metadata

Extensions
**********

All relations can have extensions, which provides a way to add application specific
functionality to the relation. They are defined by providing a block to the relation definition.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     embeds_many :addresses do
       def find_by_country(country)
         where(country: country).first
       end
       def chinese
         _target.select { |address| address.country == "China" }
       end
     end
   end
  
   person.addresses.find_by_country("Mongolia") # returns address
   person.addresses.chinese # returns [ address ]

Custom Relation Names
*********************

You can name your relations whatever you like, but if the class cannot be inferred by
Mongoid from the name, and neither can the opposite side you'll want to provide the
macro with some additional options to tell Mongoid how to hook them up.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Lush
     include Mongoid::Document
     embeds_one :whiskey, class_name: "Drink", inverse_of: :alcoholic
   end
   
   class Drink
     include Mongoid::Document
     embedded_in :alcoholic, class_name: "Lush", inverse_of: :whiskey
   end

Custom Primary & Foreign Keys
*****************************

The fields used when looking up associations can be explicitly specified.
The default is to use ``id`` on the "parent" association and ``#{association_name}_id``
on the "child" association, for example with a has_many/belongs_to:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Company
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_many :emails
  end
  
  class Email
    include Mongoid::Document
    belongs_to :company
  end
  
  company = Company.find(id)
  # looks up emails where emails.company_id == company.id
  company.emails

Specify a different ``primary_key`` to change the field name on the "parent"
association and ``foreign_key`` to change the field name on the "child"
association:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Company
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :c, type: String
    has_many :emails, foreign_key: 'c_ref', primary_key: 'c'
  end

  class Email
    include Mongoid::Document
    # This definition of c_ref is automatically generated by Mongoid:
    # field :c_ref, type: Object
    # But the type can also be specified:
    field :c_ref, type: String
    belongs_to :company, foreign_key: 'c_ref', primary_key: 'c'
  end
  
  company = Company.find(id)
  # looks up emails where emails.c_ref == company.c
  company.emails

With a has_and_belongs_to_many association, primary key is the field on
the remote model that contains the value by which the remote model is
looked up, and foreign key is the field on the local model which stores
these values. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Company
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    field :c_id, type: Integer
    field :e_ids, type: Array
    
    has_and_belongs_to_many :employees, primary_key: :e_id, foreign_key: :e_ids
  end
  
  class Employee
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    field :e_id, type: Integer
    field :c_ids, type: Array
    
    has_and_belongs_to_many :companies, primary_key: :c_id, foreign_key: :c_ids
  end
  
  company = Company.create!(c_id: 123)
  # => #<Company _id: 5c565ece026d7c461d8a9d4e, c_id: 123, e_ids: nil>
  
  employee = Employee.create!(e_id: 456)
  # => #<Employee _id: 5c565ee8026d7c461d8a9d4f, e_id: 456, c_ids: nil>

  company.employees << employee
  
  company
  # => #<Company _id: 5c565ece026d7c461d8a9d4e, c_id: 123, e_ids: [456]>

Note that just like with the default ``#{association_name}_id`` field,
Mongoid automatically adds a field for the custom foreign key ``c_ref`` to
the model. However, since Mongoid doesn't know what type of data should be
allowed in the field, the field is created with a type of Object. It is a
good idea to explicitly define the field with the appropriate type.

Validations
***********

It is important to note that by default, Mongoid will validate the children of any
relation that are loaded into memory via a ``validates_associated``. The relations that
this applies to are:

- ``embeds_many``
- ``embeds_one``
- ``has_many``
- ``has_one``
- ``has_and_belongs_to_many``

If you do not want this behavior, you may turn it off when defining the relation.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
   
     embeds_many :addresses, validate: false
     has_many :posts, validate: false
   end


Polymorphism
************

One to one and one to many associations support polymorphism, which is
having a single association potentially contain objects of different classes.
For example, we could model an organization in which departments and teams
have managers as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Department
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    has_one :manager, as: :unit
  end
  
  class Team
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    has_one :manager, as: :unit
  end
   
  class Manager
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    belongs_to :unit, polymorphic: true
  end
  
  dept = Department.create!
  team = Team.create!
  
  alice = Manager.create!(unit: dept)
  alice.unit == dept
  # => true
  dept.manager == alice
  # => true

To provide another example, suppose we want to track price history for
products and bundles. This can be achieved via an embedded one to many
polymorphic association:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Product
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    field :name, type: String
    has_and_belongs_to_many :bundles
    
    embeds_many :prices, as: :item
  end
  
  class Bundle
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :name, type: String
    has_and_belongs_to_many :products

    embeds_many :prices, as: :item
  end
  
  class Price
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    embedded_in :item, polymorphic: true
  end
  
  pants = Product.create!(name: 'Pants',
    prices: [Price.new, Price.new])
  costume = Bundle.create!(name: 'Costume', products: [pants],
    prices: [Price.new, Price.new])

To define a polymorphic association, specify the ``polymorphic: true`` option
on the child association and add the ``as: :association_name`` option to the
parent association.

Note that Mongoid currently supports polymorphism only in one direction - from
the child to the parent. For example, polymorphism cannot be used to specify
that a bundle may contain other bundles or products:
  
.. code-block:: ruby

  class Bundle
    include Mongoid::Document

    # Does not work:
    has_many :items, polymorphic: true
  end

``has_and_belongs_to_many`` associations do not support polymorphism.


Cascading Callbacks
*******************

If you want the embedded document callbacks to fire when calling a persistence operation on
its parent, you will need to provide the cascade callbacks option to the relation.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     embeds_many :albums, cascade_callbacks: true
     embeds_one :label, cascade_callbacks: true
   end

  band.save # Fires all save callbacks on the band, albums, and label.

Dependent Behaviour
*******************

You can provide dependent options to referenced associations to instruct Mongoid
how to handle situations where one side of the relation is deleted, or is attempted
to be deleted. The options are as follows:

- ``:delete``: Delete the child document without running any of the model callbacks.
- ``:destroy``: Destroy the child document and run all of the model callbacks.
- ``:nullify``: Orphan the child document.
- ``:restrict``: Raise an error if the child is not empty.

The default behavior of each association when no dependent option is provided is to nullify.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     has_many :albums, dependent: :delete_all
     belongs_to :label, dependent: :nullify
   end
  
   class Album
     include Mongoid::Document
     belongs_to :band
   end
  
   class Label
     include Mongoid::Document
     has_many :bands, dependent: :restrict
   end
  
   label = Label.first
   label.bands.push(Band.first)
   label.delete # Raises an error since bands is not empty.
  
   Band.first.delete # Will delete all associated albums.

Autosaving
**********

One core difference between Mongoid and Active Record from a behavior standpoint
is that Mongoid does not automatically save child relations for relational associations.
This is for performance reasons.

To enable an autosave on a relational association (embedded associations do not need
this since they are actually part of the parent in the database) add the autosave
option to the relation.

Note that autosave functionality will automatically be added to a relation when using
``accepts_nested_attributes_for`` or validating presence of the relation.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     has_many :albums, autosave: true
   end
 
   band = Band.first
   band.albums.build(name: "101")
   band.save # Will save the album as well.

Recursive Embedding
*******************

A document can recursively embed itself using ``recursively_embeds_one`` or ``recursively_embeds_many``,
which provides accessors for the parent and children via ``parent_`` and ``child_`` methods.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Tag
     include Mongoid::Document
     recursively_embeds_many
   end
  
   root = Tag.new(name: "programming")
   child_one = root.child_tags.build
   child_two = root.child_tags.build
  
   root.child_tags # [ child_one, child_two ]
   child_one.parent_tag # [ root ]
   child_two.parent_tag # [ root ]
  
   class Node
     include Mongoid::Document
     recursively_embeds_one
   end
  
   root = Node.new
   child = Node.new
   root.child_node = child
  
   root.child # child
   child.parent_node # root

Existence Predicates
********************

All relations have existence predicates on them in the form of ``name?`` and ``has_name?``
to check if the relation is blank.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     embeds_one :label
     embeds_many :albums
   end
 
   band.label?
   band.has_label?
   band.albums?
   band.has_albums?

Autobuilding
************

One to one relations (``embeds_one``, ``has_one``) have an autobuild option which tells
Mongoid to instantiate a new document when the relation is accessed and it is ``nil``.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     embeds_one :label, autobuild: true
     has_one :producer, autobuild: true
   end
  
   band = Band.new
   band.label # Returns a new empty label.
   band.producer # Returns a new empty producer.

Touching
********

Any ``belongs_to`` relation, no matter where it hangs off from, can take an optional ``:touch``
option which will call the touch method on it and any parent relations with the option defined
when the base document calls ``#touch``.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     belongs_to :label, touch: true
   end
  
   band = Band.first
   band.touch # Calls touch on the parent label.

Association metadata
--------------------

All relations in Mongoid contain metadata that holds information about the relation in
question, and is a valuable tool for third party developers to use to extend Mongoid.

You can access the association metadata of the relation in a few different ways.

.. code-block:: ruby

   # Get the metadata for a named association from the class or document.
   Model.reflect_on_association(:relation_name)
   model.reflect_on_association(:relation_name)
 
   # Get the metadata with a specific relation itself on a specific
   # document.
   model.associations[:relation_name]

The Association Object
**********************

The association object itself contains more information than one might know what to do
with, and is useful for developers of extensions to Mongoid.

Embeds One
----------

One to one relationships where the children are embedded in the parent document are defined
using Mongoid's ``embeds_one`` and ``embedded_in`` macros.

Defining
********

The parent document of the relation should use the ``embeds_one`` macro to indicate is has 1
embedded child, where the document that is embedded uses ``embedded_in``. Definitions are required
on both sides to the relation in order for it to work properly.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     embeds_one :label
   end
  
   class Label
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :name, type: String
     embedded_in :band
   end

Storage
*******

Documents that are embedded using the ``embeds_one`` macro are stored as a hash inside the
parent in the parent's database collection.

.. code-block:: ruby

  {
    "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9"),
    "label" : {
      "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e0"),
      "name" : "Mute",
    }
  }

You can optionally tell Mongoid to store the embedded document in a different attribute other
than the name, by providing a ``:store_as`` option.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    embeds_one :label, store_as: "lab"
  end


Embeds Many
-----------

One to many relationships where the children are embedded in the parent document are defined
using Mongoid's ``embeds_many`` and ``embedded_in`` macros.

Defining
********

The parent document of the relation should use the ``embeds_many`` macro to indicate it has n
number of embedded children, where the document that is embedded uses ``embedded_in``. Definitions
are required on both sides to the relation in order for it to work properly.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    embeds_many :albums
  end

  class Album
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    embedded_in :band
  end

Storage
*******

Documents that are embedded using the ``embeds_many`` macro are stored as an array of hashes
inside the parent in the parent's database collection.

.. code-block:: ruby

  {
    "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9"),
    "albums" : [
      {
        "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e0"),
        "name" : "Violator",
      }
    ]
  }

You can optionally tell Mongoid to store the embedded document in a different attribute other
than the name, by providing a ``:store_as`` option.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    embeds_many :albums, store_as: "albs"
  end


Has One
-------

One to one relationships where the children are referenced in the parent document are defined
using Mongoid's ``has_one`` and ``belongs_to`` macros.

Defining
********

The parent document of the relation should use the ``has_one`` macro to indicate is has 1 referenced
child, where the document that is referenced in it uses ``belongs_to``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_one :studio
  end

  class Studio
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    belongs_to :band
  end

Definitions are required on both sides to the relation in order for it to work properly, unless
one of the models is embedded.

Storage
*******

When defining a relation of this nature, each document is stored in its respective collection,
but the child document contains a "foreign key" reference to the parent.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # The parent band document.
  { "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9") }

  # The child studio document.
  {
    "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7f1"),
    "band_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9")
  }


Has Many
--------

One to many relationships where the children are stored in a separate collection from the parent
document are defined using Mongoid's ``has_many`` and ``belongs_to`` macros. This exhibits similar
behavior to Active Record.

Defining
********

The parent document of the relation should use the ``has_many`` macro to indicate is has n number
of referenced children, where the document that is referenced uses ``belongs_to``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_many :members
  end

  class Member
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    belongs_to :band
  end

Definitions are required on both sides to the relation in order for it to work properly,
unless one of the models is embedded.

Storage
*******

When defining a relation of this nature, each document is stored in its respective collection,
but the child document contains a "foreign key" reference to the parent.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # The parent band document.
  { "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9") }

  # A child member document.
  {
    "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7f1"),
    "band_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9")
  }

Belongs To
----------

A ``belongs_to`` macro is used when a document is the child in a ``has_one`` or ``has_many`` association.
By default, a child document cannot be saved unless it's associated with a parent. To override this requirement,
you can use the option, ``optional: false``.

Defining
********

The child document of the relation uses the ``belongs_to`` macro to indicate it is associated with a parent.
The document on the ``belongs_to`` side stores the reference to the parent.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_one :studio
  end

  class Studio
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    belongs_to :band
  end

Definitions are required on both sides to the relation in order for it to work properly, unless
one of the models is embedded.

Storage
*******

When defining a relation of this nature, each document is stored in its respective collection,
but the child document contains a "foreign key" reference to the parent.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # The parent band document.
  { "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9") }

  # The child studio document.
  {
    "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7f1"),
    "band_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9")
  }

Has And Belongs To Many
-----------------------

Many to many relationships where the inverse documents are stored in a separate collection
from the base document are defined using Mongoid's ``has_and_belongs_to_many`` macro. This
exhibits similar behavior to Active Record with the exception that no join collection is needed,
the foreign key ids are stored as arrays on either side of the relation.

Defining
********

Both sides of the relation use the same macro.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_and_belongs_to_many :tags
  end

  class Tag
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    has_and_belongs_to_many :bands
  end

You can create a one sided many to many if you want to mimic a has_many that stores the keys
as an array on the parent.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_and_belongs_to_many :tags, inverse_of: nil
  end

  class Tag
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
  end

Storage
*******

When defining a relation of this nature, each document is stored in its respective collection,
and each document contains a "foreign key" reference to the other in the form of an array.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # The band document.
  {
    "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9"),
    "tag_ids" : [ ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7f2") ]
  }

  # The tag document.
  {
    "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7f2"),
    "band_ids" : [ ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9") ]
  }

The counter_cache option
------------------------

As with ActiveRecord, the :counter_cache option can be used on a relation to make finding the
number of belonging objects more efficient. Also similar to ActiveRecord, you must take into
account that there will be an extra attribute on the associated model. This means that with Mongoid,
you need to include ``Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic`` on the associated model.
For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Order
    include Mongoid::Document
    belongs_to :customer, counter_cache: true
  end

  class Customer
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic
    has_many :orders
  end
