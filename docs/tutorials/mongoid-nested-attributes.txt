Nested attributes provide a mechanism for updating documents and their
associations in a single operation by nesting attributes in a single
parameters hash. This is useful when wanting to edit multiple documents
within a single web form.

Behavior
========

Nested attributes can be enabled for any association, embedded or referenced.
To enable this for an association, simply provide the association name to the
``accepts_nested_attributes_for`` macro.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     embeds_many :albums
     belongs_to :producer
     accepts_nested_attributes_for :albums, :producer
   end

Note that when you add nested attributes functionality to a referenced
association, Mongoid will automatically enable autosave for that association.

When an association gains nested attributes behavior, an additional method is
added to the base model, which should be used to update the attributes with
the new functionality. This method is the association name plus ``_attributes=``.
You can use this method directly, or more commonly the name of the method can
be an attribute in the updates for the base class, in which case
Mongoid will call the appropriate setter under the covers.

.. code-block:: ruby

   band = Band.first
   band.producer_attributes = { name: "Flood" }
   band.attributes = { producer_attributes: { name: "Flood" }}

Note that this will work with any attribute based setter method in Mongoid. This includes:
``update_attributes``, ``update_attributes!`` and ``attributes=``.
