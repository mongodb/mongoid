Documents are the core objects in Mongoid and any object that is to be persisted to the
database must include ``Mongoid::Document``. The representation of a Document in MongoDB
is a BSON object that is very similar to a Ruby hash or JSON object. Documents can be stored
in their own collections in the database, or can be embedded in other Documents n levels deep.
