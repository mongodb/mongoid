New Application
---------------

This section shows how to create a new Ruby on Rails application using Mongoid
for data access. The application will be similar to the blog application
described in the `Ruby on Rails Getting Started
<https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-the-blog-application>`_
guide, however using Mongoid instead of ActiveRecord as the database adapter.


Install ``rails``
*****************

We will use a Rails generator to create the application skeleton.
In order to do so, he first step is to install the ``rails`` gem:

.. code-block:: sh

    gem install rails -v '~> 6.0.0'


Create New Application
**********************

Use the ``rails`` command to create the application skeleton, as follows:

.. code-block:: sh

    rails new blog --skip-active-record --skip-bundle
    cd blog

.. note::

    You may receive a warning like this:

    .. code-block:: sh

        Could not find gem 'puma (~> 3.11)' in any of the gem sources listed in your Gemfile.
        Run `bundle install` to install missing gems.
        
    Disregard it as we will be taking care of gem installation
    in a moment.

We pass ``--skip-active-record`` to request that ActiveRecord is not added
as a dependency, because we will be using Mongoid instead. Additionaly
we pass ``--skip-bundle`` because we'll be modifying the ``Gemfile`` to
add the ``mongoid`` dependency.

If you intend to test your application with RSpec, you can instruct the
generator to omit default Rails test setup by passing ``--skip-test``
and ``--skip-system-test`` options:

.. code-block:: sh

    rails new blog --skip-bundle --skip-active-record --skip-test --skip-system-test
    cd blog


Create Git Repo
***************

While not required, we recommend creating a Git repository for your application:

.. code-block:: sh

    git init .
    git add .
    git commit

Commit your changes as you are following this tutorial.


Add Mongoid
***********

1. Modify the ``Gemfile`` to add a reference to the
`mongoid <https://rubygems.org/gems/mongoid/>`_ gem:

.. code-block:: ruby

    gem 'mongoid', '~> 7.0.5'

.. note::

    Mongoid 7.0.5 or higher is required to use Rails 6.0.

2. Install gem dependencies:

.. code-block:: sh

    bundle install

3. Generate the default Mongoid configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

    bin/rails g mongoid:config

This generator will create the ``config/mongoid.yml`` configuration file,
which we will use to configure our connection to the MongoDB deployment.
Note that as we are not using ActiveRecord we will not have a ``database.yml``
file.


Run MongoDB Locally
*******************

The configuration created in the previous step is suitable when
a MongoDB server is running locally. If you do not already have a
local MongoDB server, `download and install MongoDB
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/>`_.

While the generated ``mongoid.yml`` will work without modifications,
we recommend reducing the server selection timeout for development.
With this change, the uncommented lines of ``mongoid.yml`` should look
like this:

.. code-block:: none

    development:
      clients:
        default:
          database: blog_development
          hosts:
            - localhost:27017
          options:
            server_selection_timeout: 1


Use MongoDB Atlas
*****************

Instead of downloading, installing and running MongoDB locally, you can create
a free MongoDB Atlas account and create a `free MongoDB cluster in Atlas
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/atlas-free-tier-setup/>`_.
Once the cluster is created, follow the instructions in `connect to the cluster
page <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/connect-to-cluster/#connect-to-a-cluster>`_
to obtain the URI. Use the *Ruby driver 2.5 or later* format.

Paste the URI into the ``config/mongoid.yml`` file, and comment out the
hosts that are defined. We recommend setting the server selection timeout to 5
seconds for development environment when using Atlas.

The uncommented contents of ``config/mongoid.yml`` should look like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    development:
      clients:
        default:
          uri: mongodb+srv://user:pass@yourcluster.mongodb.net/blog_development?retryWrites=true&w=majority
          options:
            server_selection_timeout: 5


Other Rails Dependencies
************************

If this is the first Rails application you are creating, you may need to
install Node.js on your computer. This can be done via your operating system
packages or by `downloading a binary <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>`_.

Next, if you do not have Yarn installed, `follow its installation instructions
<https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/>`_.

Finally, install webpacker:

.. code-block:: sh

    rails webpacker:install 


Run Application
***************

You can now start the application server by running:

.. code-block:: sh

    rails s

Access the application by navigating to `localhost:3000
<http://localhost:3000>`_.


Add Posts
*********

Using the standard Rails scaffolding, Mongoid can generate the necessary
model, controller and view files for our blog so that we can quickly begin
creating blog posts:

.. code-block:: sh

    bin/rails g scaffold Post title:string body:text

Navigate to `localhost:3000/posts <http://localhost:3000/posts>`_
to create posts and see the posts that have already been created.

Add Comments
************

To make our application more interactive, let's add the ability for users to
add comments to our posts.

Create the ``Comment`` model:

.. code-block:: sh

    bin/rails g scaffold Comment name:string message:string post:belongs_to

Open the ``Post`` model file, ``app/models/post.rb``, and add a ``has_many``
association for the comments:

.. code-block:: ruby
  :name: app/models/post.rb
  :caption: app/models/post.rb

    class Post
      include Mongoid::Document
      
      field :title, type: String
      field :body, type: String

      has_many :comments, dependent: :destroy
    end

Open the ``Comment`` model file, ``app/models/comment.rb``, and change the
generated ``embedded_in`` association to ``belongs_to``:

.. code-block:: ruby
  :name: app/models/comment.rb
  :caption: app/models/comment.rb

    class Comment
      include Mongoid::Document
      
      field :name, type: String
      field :message, type: String

      belongs_to :post, dependent: :destroy
    end

Open the post show view file, ``app/views/posts/show.html.erb``, and add
a section rendering existing comments and prompting to leave a new comment:

.. code-block:: html
  :name: app/views/posts/show.html.erb
  :caption: app/views/posts/show.html.erb

  <section class="section comments">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="subtitle is-5">
        <strong><%= @post.comments.count %></strong> Comments
      </h2>
      <%= render @post.comments %>
      <div class="comment-form">
        <hr />
        <h3 class="subtitle is-3">Leave a reply</h3>
        <%= render partial: 'comments/form', locals: { comment: @post.comments.build } %>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

Open the comment form file and change the type of field for ``:message``
from ``text_field`` to ``text_area``, as well as the type of field for
``:post_id`` from ``text_field`` to ``hidden_field``. The result
should look like this:

.. code-block:: html
  :name: app/views/comments/_form.html.erb
  :caption: app/views/comments/_form.html.erb

  <%= form_with(model: comment, local: true) do |form| %>
    <% if comment.errors.any? %>
      <div id="error_explanation">
        <h2><%= pluralize(comment.errors.count, "error") %> prohibited this comment from being saved:</h2>

        <ul>
          <% comment.errors.full_messages.each do |message| %>
            <li><%= message %></li>
          <% end %>
        </ul>
      </div>
    <% end %>

    <div class="field">
      <%= form.label :name %>
      <%= form.text_field :name %>
    </div>

    <div class="field">
      <%= form.label :message %>
      <%= form.text_area :message %>
    </div>

    <div class="field">
      <%= form.hidden_field :post_id %>
    </div>

    <div class="actions">
      <%= form.submit %>
    </div>
  <% end %>

Create a partial for the comment view, ``app/view/comments/_comment.html.erb``
with the following contents:

.. code-block:: html
  :name: app/views/comments/_comment.html.erb
  :caption: app/views/comments/_comment.html.erb

  <p>
    <strong><%= comment.name %>:</strong>
    <%= comment.message %>
  <br>
  <%= link_to 'Delete', [comment],
    method: :delete,
    class: "button is-danger",
    data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } %>
  </p>

You should now be able to leave comments for the posts:
