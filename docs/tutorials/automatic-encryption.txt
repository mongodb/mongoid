Since version 4.2 MongoDB supports `Client-Side Field Level Encryption
(CSFLE) <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/csfle/>`_. This is a feature
that enables you to encrypt data in your application before you send it over the
network to MongoDB. With CSFLE enabled, no MongoDB product has access to your
data in an unencrypted form.

You can set up CSFLE using the following mechanisms:

* `Automatic Encryption <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/csfle/fundamentals/automatic-encryption/>`_:
  Enables you to perform encrypted read and write operations without you having
  to write code to specify how to encrypt fields.
* `Explicit Encryption <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/csfle/fundamentals/manual-encryption/>`_:
  Enables you to perform encrypted read and write operations through your
  MongoDB driver's encryption library. You must specify the logic for encryption
  with this library throughout your application.

Starting with version 9.0, Mongoid supports CSFLE's Automatic Encryption
feature. This tutorial walks you through the process of setting up and using
CSFLE in Mongoid.

.. note::
  This tutorial does not cover all CSLFE features.
  You can find more information about MongoDB CSFLE in
  `the server documentation. <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/csfle/>`_

.. note::
  If you want to use explicit FLE, please follow `the Ruby driver documentation.
  <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/ruby-driver/current/reference/client-side-encryption/#explicit-encryption>`_


Installation
============

You can find the detailed description of how to install the necessary
dependencies in `the driver documentation. <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/ruby-driver/current/reference/client-side-encryption/#installation>`_

Note the version of the Ruby driver being used in your application and select
the appropriate steps below.

Install ``libmongocrypt``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This can be done one of two ways.

* Add the `libmongocrypt-helper gem <https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt-helper-ruby>`_ to
  your ``Gemfile`` or
* Download the ``libmongocrypt`` `release archive <https://s3.amazonaws.com/mciuploads/libmongocrypt/all/master/latest/libmongocrypt-all.tar.gz>`_,
  extract the version that matches your operating system, and set the
  ``LIBMONGOCRYPT_PATH`` environment variable accordingly.

Install the automatic encryption shared library (Ruby driver 2.19+)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use the Ruby driver version 2.19 and above the automatic encryption
shared library should be installed by following the instructions in the
`MongoDB manual <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/queryable-encryption/reference/shared-library/#download-the-automatic-encryption-shared-library>`_.

The steps required are as follows:

1. Navigate to the `MongoDB Download Center <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/enterprise>`_
2. From the Version dropdown, select ``x.y.z (current)`` (the latest current version).
3. In the Platform dropdown, select your platform.
4. In the Package dropdown, select ``crypt_shared``.
5. Click Download.

Once extracted, ensure the full path to the library is configured within your
``mongoid.yml`` as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

  development:
    clients:
      default:
        options:
          auto_encryption_options:
            extra_options:
              crypt_shared_lib_path: '/path/to/mongo_crypt_v1.so'

Install the ``mongocryptd`` (Ruby driver 2.18 or older)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using an older version of the Ruby driver ``mongocryptd`` will
need to be installed manually. ``mongocryptd`` comes pre-packaged with
enterprise builds of the MongoDB server (versions 4.2 and newer).
For installation instructions, see the `MongoDB manual <https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/security-client-side-encryption-appendix/#installation>`_.

Add ``ffi`` to your Gemfile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB Ruby driver uses the `ffi gem <https://github.com/ffi/ffi>`_ to call
functions from ``libmongocrypt``. As this gem is not a dependency of
the driver, it will need to be manually added to your ``Gemfile``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  gem 'ffi'

Create a Customer Master Key
============================

A Customer Master Key (CMK) is used to encrypt Data Encryption Keys.
The easiest way is to use a locally stored 96-bytes key. You can generate such
a key using the following Ruby code:

.. code-block:: ruby

  require 'securerandom'

  SecureRandom.hex(48) # => "f54ab...."

Later in this tutorial we assume that the Customer Master Key is
available from the ``CUSTOMER_MASTER_KEY`` environment variable.

.. warning::

  Using a local master key is insecure. It is recommended that you use a remote
  Key Management Service to create and store your master key. To do so, follow
  steps of the `"Set up a Remote Master Key" <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/csfle/tutorials/#set-up-a-remote-master-key>`_
  in the MongoDB Client-Side Encryption documentation.

  For more information about creating a master key, see the
  `Create a Customer Master Key <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/csfle/quick-start/#create-a-customer-master-key>`_
  section of the MongoDB manual.

Configure Clients
=================

Automatic CSFLE requires some additional configuration for the MongoDB client.
Assuming that your application has just one ``default`` client, you need to
add the following to your ``mongoid.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

  development:
    clients:
      default:
        uri: mongodb+srv://user:pass@yourcluster.mongodb.net/blog_development?retryWrites=true&w=majority
        options:
          auto_encryption_options: # This key enables automatic encryption
            key_vault_namespace: 'encryption.__keyVault' # Database and collection to store data keys
            kms_providers: # Tells the driver where to obtain master keys
              local: # We use the local key in this tutorial
                key: "<%= ENV['CUSTOMER_MASTER_KEY'] %>" # Key that we generated earlier
            extra_options:
              crypt_shared_lib_path: '/path/to/mongo_crypt_v1.so' # Only if you use the library


Create a Data Encryption Key
============================

A Data Encryption Key (DEK) is the key you use to encrypt the fields in your
MongoDB documents. You store your Data Encryption Key in your Key Vault
collection encrypted with your CMK.

To create a DEK in Mongoid you can use the
``db:mongoid:encryption:create_data_key`` ``Rake`` task:

.. code-block:: sh

  % rake db:mongoid:encryption:create_data_key
  Created data key with id: 'KImyywsTQWi1+cFYIHdtlA==' for kms provider: 'local' in key vault: 'encryption.__keyVault'.

You can create multiple DEKs, if necessary.

.. code-block:: sh

  % rake db:mongoid:encryption:create_data_key
  Created data key with id: 'Vxr5m+5cQISjDOruzZgE0w==' for kms provider: 'local' in key vault: 'encryption.__keyVault'.

You can also provide an alternate name for the DEK. This allows you to reference
the DEK by name when configuring encryption for your fields. It also allows you
to dynamically assign a DEK to a field at runtime.

.. code-block:: sh

  % rake db:mongoid:encryption:create_data_key -- --key-alt-name=my_data_key
  Created data key with id: 'yjF8hKmKQsqGeFGXlB9Sow==' with key alt name: 'my_data_key' for kms provider: 'local' in key vault: 'encryption.__keyVault'.


Configure Encryption Schema
===========================

Now we can tell Mongoid what should be encrypted:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Patient
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Mongoid::Timestamps

    # Tells Mongoid what DEK should be used to encrypt fields of the document
    # and its embedded documents.
    encrypt_with key_id: 'KImyywsTQWi1+cFYIHdtlA=='

    # This field is not encrypted.
    field :category, type: String

    # This field is encrypted using AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Random
    # algorithm.
    field :passport_id, type: String, encrypt: {
        deterministic: false
    }
    # This field is encrypted using AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Deterministic
    # algorithm.
    field :blood_type, type: String, encrypt: {
        deterministic: true
    }
    # This field is encrypted using AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Random
    # algorithm and using  a different data key.
    field :ssn, type: Integer, encrypt: {
        deterministic: false, key_id: 'Vxr5m+5cQISjDOruzZgE0w=='
    }

    embeds_one :insurance
  end

  class Insurance
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Mongoid::Timestamps

    field :insurer, type: String

    # This field is encrypted using AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Random
    # algorithm using the key which alternate name is stored in the
    # policy_number_key field.
    field :policy_number, type: Integer, encrypt: {
        deterministic: false,
        key_name_field: :policy_number_key
    }

    embedded_in :patient
  end

.. note::
  If you are developing a Rails application, it is recommended to set
  ``preload_models`` to ``true`` in ``mongoid.yml``. This will ensure that
  Mongoid loads all models before the application starts, and the encryption
  schema is configured before any data is read or written.

Known Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* MongoDB CSFLE has some limitations that are described in
  `the server documentation. <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/csfle/reference/limitations/>`_
  These limitations also apply to Mongoid.
* Mongoid does not support encryption of ``embeds_many`` relations.
* If you use ``:key_name_field`` option, the field must be encrypted using
  non-deterministic algorithm. To encrypt your field deterministically, you must
  specify ``:key_id`` option instead.

Working with Data
=================

Automatic CSFLE usage is transparent in many situations.

.. note::
  In code examples below we assume that there is a variable ``unencrypted_client``
  that is a ``MongoClient`` connected to the same database but without encryption.
  We use this client to demonstrate what is actually persisted in the database.

Documents can be created as usual, fields will be encrypted and decrypted
according to the configuration:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Patient.create!(
    category: 'ER',
    passport_id: '123456',
    blood_type: 'AB+',
    ssn: 98765,
    insurance: Insurance.new(insurer: 'TK', policy_number: 123456, policy_number_key: 'my_data_key')
  )

  # Fields are encrypted in the database
  unencrypted_client['patients'].find.first
  # =>
  # {"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('6446a1d046ebfd701f9f4292'),
  # "category"=>"ER",
  # "passport_id"=><BSON::Binary:0x404080 type=ciphertext data=0x012889b2cb0b1341...>,
  # "blood_type"=><BSON::Binary:0x404560 type=ciphertext data=0x022889b2cb0b1341...>,
  # "ssn"=><BSON::Binary:0x405040 type=ciphertext data=0x012889b2cb0b1341...>,
  # "insurance"=>{"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('6446a1d046ebfd701f9f4293'), "insurer"=>"TK", "policy_number"=><BSON::Binary:0x405920 type=ciphertext data=0x012889b2cb0b1341...>}, "policy_number_key"=>"my_data_key"}

Fields encrypted using a deterministic algorithm can be queried. Only exact match
queries are supported. For more details please consult `the server documentation
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/csfle/reference/supported-operations/#supported-query-operators>`_.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # We can find documents by deterministically encrypted fields.
  Patient.where(blood_type: "AB+").to_a
  # => [#<Patient _id: 6447e34d46ebfd3debdd9c39, category: "ER", passport_id: "123456", blood_type: "AB+", ssn: 98765>]

Encryption Key Management
=========================

Customer Master Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your Customer Master Key is the key you use to encrypt your Data Encryption Keys.
MongoDB automatically encrypts Data Encryption Keys using the specified CMK
during Data Encryption Key creation.

The CMK is the most sensitive key in CSFLE. If your CMK is compromised, all of
your encrypted data can be decrypted.

.. important::
  Ensure you store your Customer Master Key (CMK) on a remote KMS.

  To learn more about why you should use a remote KMS, see `Reasons to Use a Remote KMS. <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/csfle/fundamentals/manage-keys/#std-label-csfle-reasons-to-use-remote-kms>`_

  To view a list of all supported KMS providers, see the `KMS Providers <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/csfle/reference/kms-providers/#std-label-csfle-reference-kms-providers>`_ page.

MongoDB CSFLE supports the following Key Management System (KMS) providers:
  * `Amazon Web Services KMS <https://aws.amazon.com/kms/>`_
  * `Azure Key Vault <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/key-vault>`_
  * `Google Cloud Platform KMS <https://cloud.google.com/security-key-management>`_
  * Any KMIP Compliant Key Management System
  * Local Key Provider (for testing only)

Data Encryption Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data Encryption Keys can be created using the
``db:mongoid:encryption:create_data_key`` ``Rake`` task. By default they are
stored on the same cluster as the database.
However, it might be a good idea to store the keys separately. This can be
done by specifying a key vault client in ``mongoid.yml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

  development:
    clients:
      key_vault:
        uri: mongodb+srv://user:pass@anothercluster.mongodb.net/blog_development?retryWrites=true&w=majority
      default:
        uri: mongodb+srv://user:pass@yourcluster.mongodb.net/blog_development?retryWrites=true&w=majority
        options:
          auto_encryption_options:
            key_vault_client: :key_vault # Client to connect to key vault
            # ...

Encryption Keys Rotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can rotate encryption keys using the ``rewrap_many_data_key`` method
of the Ruby driver. This method automatically decrypts multiple data encryption
keys and re-encrypts them using a specified CMK. It then updates
the rotated keys in the key vault collection. This method allows you to rotate
encryption keys based on two optional arguments:

* A filter used to specify which keys to rotate. If no data key matches the
  given filter, no keys will be rotated. Omit the filter to rotate all keys in
  your key vault collection.
* An object that represents a new CMK. Omit this object to rotate the data
  keys using their current CMKs.

Here is an example of rotating keys using AWS KMS:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Create a key vault client
  key_vault_client = Mongo::Client.new('mongodb+srv://user:pass@yourcluster.mongodb.net')
  # Or, if you declared the key value client in mongoid.yml, use it
  key_vault_client = Mongoid.client(:key_vault)

  # Create the encryption object
  encryption = Mongo::ClientEncryption.new(
    key_vault_client,
    key_vault_namespace: 'encryption.__keyVault',
    kms_providers: {
      aws: {
        "accessKeyId": "<IAM User Access Key ID>",
        "secretAccessKey": "<IAM User Secret Access Key>"
      }
    }
  )

  encryption.rewrap_many_data_key(
    {}, # We want to rewrap all keys
    {
      provider: 'aws',
      master_key: {
        region: 'us-east-2',
        key: 'arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:...'
      }
    }
  )

Adding Automatic Encryption To Existing Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB automatic CSFLE supports encryption in place. You can enable encryption
for your existing database, and will still able to read unencrypted data.
All data written to the database will be encrypted. However, as soon as the
encryption is enabled, all query operations will use encrypted data:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # We assume that there are two documents in the database, one created without
  # encryption enabled, and one with encryption.

  # We can still read both.
  Patient.all.to_a
  # =>
  # [#<Patient _id: 644937ac46ebfd02468e58c8, category: "ER", passport_id: "DE-1257", blood_type: "AB+", ssn: 123456>,
  # #<Patient _id: 644937c946ebfd029309b912, category: "ER", passport_id: "AT-1545", blood_type: "AB+", ssn: 987654>]

  # But when we query, we can see only the latter one.
  Patient.where(blood_type: 'AB+').to_a
  # => [#<Patient _id: 644937c946ebfd029309b912, category: "ER", passport_id: "AT-1545", blood_type: "AB+", ssn: 987654>]

If you want to encrypt the existing database, it can be achieved by reading
and writing back all data, even without any changes. If you decide to do so,
please keep the following in mind:

* Validate the integrity of existing data for consistent fidelity. CSFLE is
  type sensitive - for example you cannot store integers in a field that is
  declared as ``String``.
* For strings, make sure that empty values are always empty strings or just
  not set, but not ``nil`` (CSFLE doesn't support native ``null``).
* This operation requires application downtime.
