Mongoid can assist with setting up collection sharding in sharded environments.


.. _shard-keys:

Declaring Shard Keys
====================

Shard keys can be declared on models using the ``shard_key`` macro:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :ssn

    shard_key ssn: 1

    # The collection must also have an index that starts with the shard key.
    index ssn: 1
  end

Note that in order to shard a collection, the collection must have an index
that starts with the shard key. Mongoid provides `index management
<mongoid-indexes>`_ functionality, which the examples here take
advantage of.

Mongoid supports two syntaxes for declaring shard keys. The standard syntax
follows the format of MongoDB `shardCollection shell helper
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/sh.shardCollection/#sh.shardCollection>`_
and allows specifying ranged and hashed shard keys, compound shard keys and
collection sharding options:

.. code-block:: ruby

  shard_key ssn: 1

  shard_key ssn: 1, country: 1

  shard_key ssn: :hashed

  shard_key {ssn: :hashed}, unique: true

The alternative is the shorthand syntax, in which only the keys are given.
This syntax only supports ranged shard keys and does not allow options to
be specified:

.. code-block:: ruby

  shard_key :ssn

  shard_key :ssn, :country

``shard_key`` macro can take the name of a ``belongs_to`` association in
place of a field name, in which case Mongoid will use the foreign key
configured in the association as the field name:

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document

    belongs_to :country

    # Shards by country_id.
    shard_key country: 1

    # The collection must also have an index that starts with the shard key.
    index country: 1
  end

.. note::

  If a model declares a shard key, Mongoid expects the respective collection
  to be sharded with the specified shard key. When reloading models, Mongoid
  will provide the shard key in addition to the ``id`` field value to the
  ``find`` command to improve query performance, especially on `geographically
  distributed sharded clusters <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/global-clusters/>`_.
  If the collection is not sharded with the specified shard key, queries
  may produce incorrect results.


.. _sharding-management:

Sharding Management Rake Tasks
==============================

To shard collections in the database according to the shard keys defined in
the models, run the ``db:mongoid:shard_collections`` Rake task.
If necessary, run the ``db:mongoid:create_indexes`` Rake task prior to
sharding collections:

.. code-block:: bash

  rake db:mongoid:create_indexes
  rake db:mongoid:shard_collections

.. note::

  Like with index management rake tasks, sharding management rake tasks
  generally do not stop and fail when they encounter the problem with a
  particular model class. Instead they log the problem (to the configured
  Mongoid logger) at an appropriate level and continue with the next model.
  When Mongoid is used in a Rails application, this means the results of
  the rake task execution will generally be found in the per-environment
  log file like ``log/development.log``.

.. note::

  When performing schema-related operations in a sharded cluster, such as
  sharding collections as described in this document, or creating or dropping
  collections or databases, cluster nodes may end up with out of date local
  configuration-related cache data. Execute the `flushRouterConfig
  <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/flushRouterConfig/>`_
  command on each ``mongos`` node to clear these caches.
