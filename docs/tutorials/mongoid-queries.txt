Queries
=======

Mongoid provides a rich query DSL inspired by ActiveRecord. A trivial query
looks as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.where(name: "Depeche Mode")

A more complex query utilizing various Mongoid features could be as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.
    where(:founded.gte => "1980-01-01").
    in(name: [ "Tool", "Deftones" ]).
    union.
    in(name: [ "Melvins" ])

The query methods return ``Mongoid::Criteria`` objects, which are chainable
and lazily evaluated wrappers for MongoDB query language (MQL).
The queries are executed when their result sets are iterated. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Construct a Criteria object:

  Band.where(name: 'Deftones')
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {"name"=>"Deftones"}
  #   options:  {}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>

  # Evaluate the query and get matching documents:

  Band.where(name: 'Deftones').to_a
  # => [#<Band _id: 5ebdeddfe1b83265a376a760, name: "Deftones", description: nil>]

Methods like ``first`` and ``last`` return the individual documents immediately.
Otherwise, iterating a Criteria object with methods like ``each`` or ``map``
retrieves the documents from the server. ``to_a`` can be used to force
execution of a query that returns an array of documents, literally converting
a Criteria object to an Array.

When a query method is called on a Criteria instance, the method returns a new
Criteria instance with the new conditions added to the existing conditions:

.. code-block:: ruby

  scope = Band.where(:founded.gte => "1980-01-01")
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {"founded"=>{"$gte"=>"1980-01-01"}}
  #   options:  {}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>

  scope.where(:founded.lte => "2020-01-01")
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {"founded"=>{"$gte"=>"1980-01-01", "$lte"=>"2020-01-01"}}
  #   options:  {}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>

  scope
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {"founded"=>{"$gte"=>"1980-01-01"}}
  #   options:  {}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>


Condition Syntax
----------------

Mongoid supports three ways of specifying individual conditions:

1. Field syntax.
2. MQL syntax.
3. Symbol operator syntax.

All syntaxes support querying embedded documents using the dot notation.
All syntaxes respect field types, if the field being queried is defined in the
model class, and field aliases.

The examples in this section use the following model definition:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :name, type: String
    field :founded, type: Integer
    field :m, as: :member_count, type: Integer

    embeds_one :manager
  end

  class Manager
    include Mongoid::Document

    embedded_in :band

    field :name, type: String
  end

Field Syntax
````````````

The simplest querying syntax utilizes the basic Ruby hashes. Keys can be
symbols or strings, and correspond to field names in MongoDB documents:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.where(name: "Depeche Mode")
  #   => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {"name"=>"Depeche Mode"}
  #   options:  {}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>

  # Equivalent to:

  Band.where("name" => "Depeche Mode")

MQL Syntax
``````````

An MQL operator may be specified on any field using the hash syntax:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.where(founded: {'$gt' => 1980})
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {"founded"=>{"$gt"=>1980}}
  #   options:  {}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>

  # Equivalent to:

  Band.where('founded' => {'$gt' => 1980})

Symbol Operator Syntax
``````````````````````

MQL operators may be specified as methods on symbols for the respective field
name, as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.where(:founded.gt => 1980)
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {"founded"=>{"$gt"=>1980}}
  #   options:  {}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>

Embedded Documents
``````````````````

To match values of fields of embedded documents, use the dot notation:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.where('manager.name' => 'Smith')
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {"manager.name"=>"Smith"}
  #   options:  {}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>

  Band.where(:'manager.name'.ne => 'Smith')
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {"manager.name"=>{"$ne"=>"Smith"}}
  #   options:  {}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>

.. note::

  Queries always return top-level model instances, even if all of the
  conditions are referencing embedded documents.

Field Types
```````````

In order to query on a field, it is not necessary to add the field to
:ref:`the model class definition <fields>`. However, if a field is defined in
the model class, the type of the field is taken into account when constructing
the query:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.where(name: 2020)
  #   => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {"name"=>"2020"}
  #   options:  {}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>

  Band.where(founded: 2020)
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {"founded"=>2020}
  #   options:  {}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>

Aliases
```````

Queries take into account :ref:`field aliases <field-aliases>`:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.where(name: 'Astral Projection')
  #   => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {"n"=>"Astral Projection"}
  #   options:  {}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>

Since `id` and `_id` fields are aliases, either one can be used for queries:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.where(id: '5ebdeddfe1b83265a376a760')
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('5ebdeddfe1b83265a376a760')}
  #   options:  {}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>


.. _logical-operations:

Logical Operations
------------------

Mongoid supports ``and``, ``or``, ``nor`` and ``not`` logical operations on
``Criteria`` objects. These methods take one or more hash of conditions
or another ``Criteria`` object as their arguments, with ``not`` additionally
having an argument-free version.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # and with conditions
  Band.where(label: 'Trust in Trance').and(name: 'Astral Projection')

  # or with scope
  Band.where(label: 'Trust in Trance').or(Band.where(name: 'Astral Projection'))

  # not with conditions
  Band.not(label: 'Trust in Trance', name: 'Astral Projection')

  # argument-less not
  Band.not.where(label: 'Trust in Trance', name: 'Astral Projection')

For backwards compatibility with earlier Mongoid versions, all of the logical
operation methods also accept arrays of parameters, which will be flattened
to obtain the criteria. Passing arrays to logical operations is deprecated and
may be removed in a future version of Mongoid.

The following calls all produce the same query conditions:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Condition hashes passed to separate and invocations
  Band.and(name: 'SUN Project').and(member_count: 2)

  # Multiple condition hashes in the same and invocation
  Band.and({name: 'SUN Project'}, {member_count: 2})

  # Multiple condition hashes in an array - deprecated
  Band.and([{name: 'SUN Project'}, {member_count: 2}])

  # Condition hash in where and a scope
  Band.where(name: 'SUN Project').and(Band.where(member_count: 2))

  # Condition hash in and and a scope
  Band.and({name: 'SUN Project'}, Band.where(member_count: 2))

  # Scope as an array element, nested arrays - deprecated
  Band.and([Band.where(name: 'SUN Project'), [{member_count: 2}]])

  # All produce:
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {"name"=>"SUN Project", "member_count"=>2}
  #   options:  {}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>


Operator Combinations
`````````````````````

As of Mongoid 7.1, logical operators (``and``, ``or``, ``nor`` and ``not``)
have been changed to have the the same semantics as `those of ActiveRecord
<https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html>`_.
To obtain the semantics of ``or`` as it behaved in Mongoid 7.0 and earlier,
use ``any_of`` which is described below.

When conditions are specified on the same field multiple times, all
conditions are added to the criteria:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.where(name: 1).where(name: 2).selector
  # => {"name"=>"1", "$and"=>[{"name"=>"2"}]}

  Band.where(name: 1).or(name: 2).selector
  # => {"$or"=>[{"name"=>"1"}, {"name"=>"2"}]}

``any_of``, ``nor`` and ``not`` behave similarly, with ``not`` producing
different query shapes as described below.

When ``and``, ``or`` and ``nor`` logical operators are used, they
operate on the criteria built up to that point and its argument.
``where`` has the same meaning as ``and``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # or joins the two conditions
  Band.where(name: 'Sun').or(label: 'Trust').selector
  # => {"$or"=>[{"name"=>"Sun"}, {"label"=>"Trust"}]}

  # or applies only to the first condition, the second condition is added
  # to the top level as $and
  Band.or(name: 'Sun').where(label: 'Trust').selector
  # => {"$or"=>[{"name"=>"Sun"}], "label"=>"Trust"}

  # Same as previous example - where and and are aliases
  Band.or(name: 'Sun').and(label: 'Trust').selector
  # => {"$or"=>[{"name"=>"Sun"}], "label"=>"Trust"}

  # Same operator can be stacked any number of times
  Band.or(name: 'Sun').or(label: 'Trust').selector
  # => {"$or"=>[{"name"=>"Sun"}, {"label"=>"Trust"}]}

  # The label: Foo condition is added to the top level as $and
  Band.where(name: 'Sun').or(label: 'Trust').where(label: 'Foo').selector
  # => {"$or"=>[{"name"=>"Sun"}, {"label"=>"Trust"}], "label"=>"Foo"}


``and`` Behavior
````````````````

The ``and`` method will add new simple conditions to the top level of the
criteria, unless the receiving criteria already has a condition on the
respective fields, in which case the conditions will be combined with ``$and``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.where(label: 'Trust in Trance').and(name: 'Astral Projection').selector
  # => {"label"=>"Trust in Trance Records", "name"=>"Astral Projection"}

  Band.where(name: /Best/).and(name: 'Astral Projection').selector
  # => {"name"=>/Best/, "$and"=>[{"name"=>"Astral Projection"}]}

As of Mongoid 7.1, specifying multiple criteria on the same field with ``and``
combines all criteria so specified, whereas in previous versions of Mongoid
conditions on a field sometimes replaced previously specified conditions on
the same field, depending on which form of ``and`` was used.


``or``/``nor`` Behavior
```````````````````````

``or`` and ``nor`` produce ``$or`` and ``$nor`` MongoDB operators, respectively,
using the receiver and all of the arguments as operands. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.where(name: /Best/).or(name: 'Astral Projection')
  # => {"$or"=>[{"name"=>/Best/}, {"name"=>"Astral Projection"}]}

  Band.where(name: /Best/).and(name: 'Astral Projection').
    or(Band.where(label: /Records/)).and(label: 'Trust').selector
  # => {"$or"=>[{"name"=>/Best/, "$and"=>[{"name"=>"Astral Projection"}]}, {"label"=>/Records/}], "label"=>"Trust"}

If the only condition on the receiver is another ``or``/``nor``, the new
conditions are added to the existing list:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.where(name: /Best/).or(name: 'Astral Projection').
    or(Band.where(label: /Records/)).selector
  # => {"$or"=>[{"name"=>/Best/}, {"name"=>"Astral Projection"}, {"label"=>/Records/}]}

Use ``any_of`` to add a disjunction to a Criteria object while maintaining
all of the conditions built up so far as they are.


.. _any-of:

``any_of`` Behavior
```````````````````

``any_of`` adds a disjunction built from its arguments to the existing
conditions in the criteria. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.where(label: /Trust/).any_of({name: 'Astral Projection'}, {name: /Best/})
  # => {"label"=>/Trust/, "$or"=>[{"name"=>"Astral Projection"}, {"name"=>/Best/}]}

The conditions are hoisted to the top level if possible:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.where(label: /Trust/).any_of({name: 'Astral Projection'})
  # => {"label"=>/Trust/, "name"=>"Astral Projection"}


``not`` Behavior
````````````````

``not`` method can be called without arguments, in which case it will negate
the next condition that is specified. ``not`` can also be called with one
or more hash conditions or ``Criteria`` objects, which will all be negated and
added to the criteria.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # not negates subsequent where
  Band.not.where(name: 'Best').selector
  # => {"name"=>{"$ne"=>"Best"}}

  # The second where is added as $and
  Band.not.where(name: 'Best').where(label: /Records/).selector
  # => {"name"=>{"$ne"=>"Best"}, "label"=>/Records/}

  # not negates its argument
  Band.not(name: 'Best').selector
  # => {"name"=>{"$ne"=>"Best"}}

.. note::

  ``$not`` in MongoDB server cannot be used with a string argument.
  Mongoid uses ``$ne`` operator to achieve such a negation:

  .. code-block:: ruby

    # String negation - uses $ne
    Band.not.where(name: 'Best').selector
    # => {"name"=>{"$ne"=>"Best"}}

    # Regexp negation - uses $not
    Band.not.where(name: /Best/).selector
    # => {"name"=>{"$not"=>/Best/}}

Similarly to ``and``, ``not`` will negate individual conditions for simple
field criteria. For complex conditions and when a field already has a condition
defined on it, since MongoDB server only supports the ``$not`` operator on
a per-field basis rather than globally, Mongoid emulates ``$not`` by using
an ``{'$and' => [{'$nor' => ...}]}`` construct:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Simple condition
  Band.not(name: /Best/).selector
  # => {"name"=>{"$not"=>/Best/}}

  # Complex conditions
  Band.where(name: /Best/).not(name: 'Astral Projection').selector
  # => {"name"=>/Best/, "$and"=>[{"$nor"=>[{"name"=>"Astral Projection"}]}]}

  # Symbol operator syntax
  Band.not(:name.ne => 'Astral Projection')
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {"$and"=>[{"$nor"=>[{"name"=>{"$ne"=>"Astral Projection"}}]}]}
  #   options:  {}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>

If using ``not`` with arrays or regular expressions, please note the
caveats/limitations of ``$not`` `stated in the MongoDB server documentation
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/not/>`_.


Incremental Query Construction
------------------------------

By default, when conditions are added to a query, Mongoid considers each
condition complete and independent from any other conditions potentially
present in the query. For example, calling ``in`` twice adds two separate
``$in`` conditions:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.in(name: ['a']).in(name: ['b'])
  => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    selector: {"name"=>{"$in"=>["a"]}, "$and"=>[{"name"=>{"$in"=>["b"]}}]}
    options:  {}
    class:    Band
    embedded: false>

Some operator methods support building the condition incrementally. In this
case, when an condition on a field which uses one of the supported operators
is being added, if there already is a condition on the same field using the
same operator, the operator expressions are combined according to the
specified *merge strategy*.

.. _merge-strategies:

Merge Strategies
````````````````

Mongoid provides three merge strategies:

- **Override**: the new operator instance replaces any existing conditions on
  the same field using the same operator.
- **Intersect**: if there already is a condition using the same operator on the
  same field, the values of the existing condition are intersected with the
  values of the new condition and the result is stored as the operator value.
- **Union**: if there already is a condition using the same operator on the
  same field, the values of the new condition are aded to the values of the
  exsting condition and the result is stored as the operator value.

The following snippet demonstrates all of the strategies, using ``in`` as the
example operator:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.in(name: ['a']).override.in(name: ['b'])
  => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    selector: {"name"=>{"$in"=>["b"]}}
    options:  {}
    class:    Band
    embedded: false>

  Band.in(name: ['a', 'b']).intersect.in(name: ['b', 'c'])
  => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    selector: {"name"=>{"$in"=>["b"]}}
    options:  {}
    class:    Band
    embedded: false>

  Band.in(name: ['a']).union.in(name: ['b'])
  => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    selector: {"name"=>{"$in"=>["a", "b"]}}
    options:  {}
    class:    Band
    embedded: false>

The strategy is requested by calling ``override``, ``intersect`` or ``union``
on a ``Criteria`` instance. The requested strategy applies to the next
condition method called on the query. If the next condition method called does
not support merge strategies, the strategy is reset, as shown in the following
example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.in(name: ['a']).union.ne(name: 'c').in(name: ['b'])
  => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    selector: {"name"=>{"$in"=>["a"], "$ne"=>"c"}, "$and"=>[{"name"=>{"$in"=>["b"]}}]}
    options:  {}
    class:    Band
    embedded: false>

Since ``ne`` does not support merge strategies, the ``union`` strategy was
ignored and reset and when ``in`` was invoked the second time there was no
strategy active.

Supported Operator Methods
``````````````````````````

The following operator methods support merge strategies:

- ``all``
- ``in``
- ``nin``

The set of methods may be expanded in future releases of Mongoid. For
future compatibility, only invoke a strategy method when the next method call
is an operator that supports merge strategies.

Note that the merge strategies are currently only applied when conditions are
added through the designated methods. In the following example merge strategy
is not applied because the second condition is added via ``where``, not via
``in``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.in(foo: ['a']).union.where(foo: {'$in' => 'b'})
  => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    selector: {"foo"=>{"$in"=>["a"]}, "$and"=>[{"foo"=>{"$in"=>"b"}}]}
    options:  {}
    class:    Band
    embedded: false>

This behavior may change in a future release of Mongoid and should not be
relied upon.

In contrast, it does not matter how the existing query was built when a
merge strategy-supporting operator method is invoked. In the following
example, the first condition was added through ``where`` but the strategy
mechanism still applies:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.where(foo: {'$in' => ['a']}).union.in(foo: ['b'])
  => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    selector: {"foo"=>{"$in"=>["a", "b"]}}
    options:  {}
    class:    Band
    embedded: false>

Operator Value Expansion
````````````````````````

Operator methods that support merge strategies all take ``Array`` as their value
type. Mongoid expands ``Array``-compatible types, such as a ``Range``,
when they are used with these operator methods:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.in(year: 1950..1960)
  => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    selector: {"year"=>{"$in"=>[1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960]}}
    options:  {}
    class:    Band
    embedded: false>

Additionally, Mongoid has historically wrapped non-``Array`` values in arrays,
as the following example demonstrates:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.in(year: 1950)
  => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    selector: {"year"=>{"$in"=>[1950]}}
    options:  {}
    class:    Band
    embedded: false>

This wrapping behavior is deprecated and should not be relied on. It may be
removed in a future release of Mongoid.


Query Methods
-------------

elem_match
``````````

This matcher finds documents with array fields where one of the array values
matches all of the conditions. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    field :tours, type: Array
  end

  aerosmith = Band.create!(name: 'Aerosmith', tours: [
    {city: 'London', year: 1995},
    {city: 'New York', year: 1999},
  ])

  Band.elem_match(tours: {city: 'London'}).to_a # => [aerosmith]

``elem_match`` also works with embedded associations:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    embeds_many :tours
  end

  class Tour
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :city, type: String
    field :year, type: Integer
    embedded_in :band
  end

  dm = Band.create!(name: 'Depeche Mode')
  aerosmith = Band.create!(name: 'Aerosmith')
  Tour.create!(band: aerosmith, city: 'London', year: 1995)
  Tour.create!(band: aerosmith, city: 'New York', year: 1999)

  Band.elem_match(tours: {city: 'London'}).to_a # => [aerosmith]

``elem_match`` does not work with non-embedded associations because MongoDB
does not have joins - the conditions would be added to the collection
that is the source of a non-embedded association rather than the collection
of the association's target.

``elem_match`` can also be used with recursively embedded associations,
as the following example shows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Tag
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    recursively_embeds_many
  end

  root = Tag.create!(name: 'root')
  sub1 = Tag.new(name: 'sub1', child_tags: [Tag.new(name: 'subsub1')])
  root.child_tags << sub1
  root.child_tags << Tag.new(name: 'sub2')
  root.save!

  Tag.elem_match(child_tags: {name: 'sub1'}).to_a # => [root]

  root.child_tags.elem_match(child_tags: {name: 'subsub1'}).to_a # => [sub1]


Projection
----------

The ``only`` method retrieves only the specified fields from the database. This
operation is sometimes called "projection".

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :name, type: String
    field :label, type: String

    embeds_many :tours
  end

  class Tour
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :city, type: String
    field :year, type: Integer

    embedded_in :band
  end

  band = Band.only(:name).first

Attempting to reference attributes which have not been loaded results in
``ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  band.label
  # ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError (Missing attribute: 'label'.)

Even though Mongoid currently allows writing to attributes that have not
been loaded, such writes will not be persisted
(`MONGOID-4701 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-4701>`_) and
should therefore be avoided.

``only`` can also be used with embedded associations:

.. code-block:: ruby

  band = Band.only(:name, 'tours.year').last
  # => #<Band _id: 5c59afb1026d7c034dba46ac, name: "Aerosmith">

  band.tours.first
  # => #<Tour _id: 5c59afdf026d7c034dba46af, city: nil, year: 1995>

.. note::

  Server versions 4.2 and lower allowed projecting both an association and
  the association's fields in the same query, as follows:

  .. code-block:: ruby

    band = Band.only(:tours, 'tours.year').last

  The most recent projection specification overrided the earlier one.
  For example, the above query was equivalent to:

  .. code-block:: ruby

    band = Band.only('tours.year').last

  Server versions 4.4 and higher prohibit specifying an association and its
  fields in projection in the same query.

``only`` can be specified with referenced associations (has_one, has_many,
has_and_belongs_to_many) but is currently ignored for referenced associations -
all fields of referenced associations will be loaded
(`MONGOID-4704 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-4704>`_).

Note that if a document has ``has_one`` or ``has_and_belongs_to_many`` associations,
the fields with foreign keys must be included in the list of attributes
loaded with ``only`` for those associations to be loaded. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :name, type: String

    has_and_belongs_to_many :managers
  end

  class Manager
    include Mongoid::Document

    has_and_belongs_to_many :bands
  end

  band = Band.create!(name: 'Astral Projection')
  band.managers << Manager.new

  Band.where(name: 'Astral Projection').only(:name).first.managers
  # => []

  Band.where(name: 'Astral Projection').only(:name, :manager_ids).first.managers
  # => [#<Manager _id: 5c5dc2f0026d7c1730969843, band_ids: [BSON::ObjectId('5c5dc2f0026d7c1730969842')]>]


Ordering
--------

Mongoid provides the ``order`` method on ``Criteria`` objects and its alias,
``order_by``, to specify the ordering of documents. These methods take a
hash indicating which fields to order the documents by, and whether to use
ascending or descending order for each field.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.order(name: 1)
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {}
  #   options:  {:sort=>{"name"=>1}}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>

  Band.order_by(name: -1, description: 1)
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {}
  #   options:  {:sort=>{"name"=>-1, "description"=>1}}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>

  Band.order_by(name: :desc, description: 'asc')
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {}
  #   options:  {:sort=>{"name"=>-1, "description"=>1}}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>

The direction may be specified as integers ``1`` and ``-1`` for ascending
and descending, respectively, or as symbols ``:asc`` and ``:desc``, or as
strings ``"asc"`` and ``"desc"``.

Alternatively, ``order`` accepts an array of two-element arrays specifying
the ordering. Field names and directions may be strings or symbols.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.order([['name', 'desc'], ['description', 'asc']])

  Band.order([[:name, :desc], [:description, :asc]])

Another way of providing the order is to use ``#asc`` and ``#desc`` methods
on symbols, as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.order(:name.desc, :description.asc)

The arguments can be provided as a string using SQL syntax:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.order('name desc, description asc')

Finally, there are ``asc`` and ``desc`` methods that can be used instead of
``order``/``order_by``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.asc('name').desc('description')
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    selector: {}
    options:  {:sort=>{"name"=>1, "description"=>-1}}
    class:    Band
    embedded: false>

``order`` calls can be chained, in which case the oldest calls define the
most significant criteria and the newest calls define the least significant
ones (since in Ruby hashes maintain the order of their keys):

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.order('name desc').order('description asc')
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    selector: {}
    options:  {:sort=>{"name"=>-1, "description"=>1}}
    class:    Band
    embedded: false>

This can sometimes lead to surprising results if there are scopes, including
the default scope, that use ``order``/``order_by``. For example, in the
following snippet bands are ordered by name first because the order in the
default scope takes precedence over the order given in the query, due to
the default scope being evaluated first:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :name, type: String
    field :year, type: Integer

    default_scope -> { order(name: :asc) }
  end

  Band.order(year: :desc)
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
    selector: {}
    options:  {:sort=>{"name"=>1, "year"=>-1}}
    class:    Band
    embedded: false>


.. _query-cache:

Query Cache
-----------

When the query cache is enabled, Mongoid will cache results for MongoDB queries
when the entire result set is returned in a single batch (1000 documents by
default).

Each thread has its own query cache.

When the query cache is enabled, performing most write operations (insert,
update, replace or delete) clears the cache of the thread issuing the write.

To enable the query cache manually for a code segment, use:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongoid::QueryCache.cache do
    # ...
  end

The query cache can also be explicitly enabled and disabled, although it is
recommended to use the block form described above:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongoid::QueryCache.enabled = true

  # ...

  Mongoid::QueryCache.enabled = false

Mongoid also provides a :ref:`Rack middleware <query-cache-middleware>`
to enable the query cache automatically for each web request.

The Improved Driver Query Cache
```````````````````````````````

The Mongoid query cache has been reimplemented in version 2.14.0 of the MongoDB
Ruby Driver. The driver query cache is more correct and more effective, and it
is recmomended that you upgrade to version 2.14.0 of the Ruby driver or newer.

For the purposes of this tutorial, the Mongoid query cache will be called "the
legacy query cache", and the driver query cache will be referred to as "the
driver query cache."

With driver versions 2.14.0 or newer, Mongoid will use the driver query cache
instead of the legacy query cache. When used with older versions of the driver
(that do not implement the query cache) Mongoid will fall back on the legacy
query cache.

Mongoid will retain the interface (described above) for enabling and disabling
the query cache. When using driver versions 2.14.0 or newer, this interface
will affect the driver query cache.

Read more about the Ruby driver query cache
`in the driver documentation <https://docs.mongodb.com/ruby-driver/current/tutorials/query-cache/>`_.

.. warning::

  The legacy Mongoid query cache has been deprecated in favor of the query cache
  implemented in version 2.14.0 of the MongoDB Ruby driver. While the legacy
  query cache will continue to function, the driver query cache is
  more correct and more effective. If you plan on using the query cache, it is
  recommended that you upgrade to Ruby driver version 2.14.0 or newer.

  Read more about the Ruby driver query cache
  `in the driver documentation <https://docs.mongodb.com/ruby-driver/current/tutorials/query-cache/>`_.

Legacy Query Cache Limitations
``````````````````````````````

The following is a list of limitations of the legacy query cache:

* The legacy query cache does not cache query results that exceed the batch size.
  The default batch size is 1000 documents.

* The legacy query cache does not take into account read preference or read concern
  when deciding whether to return cached results. When performing the same
  query with a different read preference or read concern with the query cache
  enabled, incorrect results may be returned.

* Bulk writes, as well as ``$out`` and ``$merge`` aggregation pipeline stages
  do not invalidate the query cache. Cached results may be stale after performing
  any of these operations.

* Aggregation results are not cached.

A Note on using ``#first``
``````````````````````````

Calling the ``first`` method on a model class imposes an ascending sort by
the ``_id`` field on the underlying query. This may produce unexpected behavior
with query caching.

For example, when calling ``all`` on a model class and then ``first``,
one would expect the second query to use the cached results from the first.
However, because of the sort imposed on the second query, both methods
will query the database and separately cache their results.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.all.to_a
  #=> Queries the database and caches the results

  Band.first
  #=> Queries the database again because of the sort

To use the cached results, call ``all.to_a.first`` on the model class.

System Collections and the Query Cache
``````````````````````````````````````

MongoDB stores system information in collections that use the ``database.system.*``
namespace pattern. These are called system collections.

Data in system collections can change due to activity not triggered by the
application (such as internal server processes) and as a result of a variety of
database commands issued by the application. Because of the difficulty of
determining when the cached results for system collections should be expired,
queries on system collections bypass the query cache.

Neither the legacy query cache nor the driver query cache will cache query
results from system collections.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.all.to_a
  #=> Queries the database and caches the results

  Band.all.to_a.first
  #=> Returns the first cached result

.. _additional-query-methods:

Additional Query Methods
------------------------

Mongoid also has some helpful methods on criteria.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 60

   * - Operation
     - Example

   * - ``Criteria#count``

       *Get the total number of documents matching a filter, or the total
       number of documents in a collection. Note this will always hit
       the database for the count.*

       *As of Mongoid 7.2, the* ``count`` *method uses the*
       ``count_documents`` *driver helper to obtain the accurate count.
       previously the* ``count`` *driver helper was used which used
       collection metadata and was thus not necessarily accurate (but
       may have returned the result faster). Use* ``estimated_count``
       *method to obtain an approximate number of documents in the collection
       quickly.*

     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          Band.count
          Band.where(name: "Photek").count

   * - ``Criteria#estimated_count``

       *Get an approximate number of documents in the collection using the
       collection metadta. The* ``estimated_count`` *method does not accept
       query conditions; if any are given, it will raise*
       ``Mongoid::Errors::InvalidEstimatedCountCriteria``.
       *If a model defines a default scope,* ``estimated_count`` *must be
       called on the unscoped model*.

     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          Band.count
          Band.where(name: "Photek").count

          class Contract
            include Mongoid::Document

            field :active, type: Boolean

            default_scope -> { where(active: true) }
          end

          Contract.estimated_count
          # => raises Mongoid::Errors::InvalidEstimatedCountCriteria

          Contract.unscoped.estimated_count
          # => 0

   * - ``Criteria#distinct``

       *Get a list of distinct values for a single field. Note this will always hit
       the database for the distinct values.*

     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          Band.distinct(:name)
          Band.where(:fans.gt => 100000).
            distinct(:name)

   * - ``Criteria#each``

       *Iterate over all matching documents in the criteria.*

     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          Band.where(members: 1).each do |band|
            p band.name
          end

   * - ``Criteria#exists?``

       *Determine if any matching documents exist. Will return true if there
       are 1 or more.*

     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          Band.exists?
          Band.where(name: "Photek").exists?

   * - ``Criteria#find``

       *Find a document or multiple documents by their ids. If the*
       ``raise_not_found_error`` *configuration option is set to* ``true``
       *which is the default and any of the ids are not found, raise an error.
       If the* ``raise_not_found_error`` *configuration option is set to*
       ``false``, return an array of documents that have the specified ids.*

     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          Band.find("4baa56f1230048567300485c")
          Band.find(
            "4baa56f1230048567300485c",
            "4baa56f1230048567300485d"
          )
          Band.where(name: "Photek").find(
            "4baa56f1230048567300485c"
          )

   * - ``Criteria#find_by``

       *Find a document by the provided attributes. If not found,
       raise an error or return nil depending on the value of the*
       ``raise_not_found_error`` *configuration option.*

     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          Band.find_by(name: "Photek")

          Band.find_by(name: "Tool") do |band|
            band.impressions += 1
          end

   * - ``Criteria#find_or_create_by``

       *Find a document by the provided attributes, and if not found
       create and return a newly persisted one. Note that attributes provided in the arguments to
       this method will override any set in ``create_with``*.

     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          Band.find_or_create_by(name: "Photek")
          Band.where(:likes.gt => 10).find_or_create_by(name: "Photek")

        ``find_or_create_by`` can be used on any scope, but in this case
        the criteria given by the scope and by ``find_or_create_by`` are
        combined. The following creates three bands:

        .. code-block:: ruby

          Band.find_or_create_by(name: "Photek")
          Band.where(name: "Photek").find_or_create_by(name: "Aerosmith")
          # creates Aerosmith again because there is no band whose name
          # is Photek and Aerosmith at the same time
          Band.where(name: "Photek").find_or_create_by(name: "Aerosmith")

   * - ``Criteria#find_or_initialize_by``

       *Find a document by the provided attributes, and if not found
       return a new one.*

     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

           Band.find_or_initialize_by(name: "Photek")
           Band.where(:likes.gt => 10).find_or_initialize_by(name: "Photek")

   * - ``Criteria#first|last``

       *Finds a single document given the provided criteria. This automatically adds a sort on id.
       Opt out of adding the id sort with the {id_sort: :none} option.*

     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          Band.first
          Band.where(:members.with_size => 3).first
          Band.where(:members.with_size => 3).last

   * - ``Criteria#first_or_create``

       *Find the first document by the provided attributes, and if not found
       create and return a newly persisted one.*

     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          Band.where(name: "Photek").first_or_create

   * - ``Criteria#first_or_create!``

       *Find the first document by the provided attributes, and if not found
       create and return a newly persisted one using* ``create!``.

     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          Band.where(name: "Photek").first_or_create!

   * - ``Criteria#first_or_initialize``

       *Find the first document by the provided attributes, and if not found
       return a new one.*

     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          Band.where(name: "Photek").first_or_initialize

   * - ``Criteria#for_js``

       *Find documents for a provided JavaScript expression, optionally with
       the specified variables added to the evaluation scope. The scope
       argument is supported in MongoDB 4.2 and lower.*
       *In MongoDB 3.6 and higher, prefer* :manual:`$expr
       </reference/operator/query/expr/>` *over* ``for_js``.

     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          # All MongoDB versions
          Band.for_js("this.name = 'Tool'")

          # MongoDB 4.2 and lower
          Band.for_js("this.name = param", param: "Tool")

   * - ``Criteria#length|size``

       *Same as count but caches subsequent calls to the database*

     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          Band.length
          Band.where(name: "FKA Twigs").size

   * - ``Criteria#pluck``

       *Get all the values for the provided field.
       Returns nil for unset fields and for non-existent fields.*

     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          Band.all.pluck(:name)


Eager Loading
-------------

Mongoid provides a facility to eager load documents
from associations to prevent the n+1 issue when
iterating over documents with association access. Eager loading is supported on
all associations with the exception of polymorphic ``belongs_to``
associations.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    has_many :albums
  end

  class Album
    include Mongoid::Document
    belongs_to :band
  end

  Band.includes(:albums).each do |band|
    p band.albums.first.name # Does not hit the database again.
  end


Regular Expressions
-------------------

MongoDB, and Mongoid, allow querying documents by regular expressions.

Given the following model definitions:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :name, type: String
    field :description, type: String
  end

  Band.create!(name: 'Sun Project', description: "Sun\nProject")

... we can query using simple Ruby regular expressions in a natural way:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.where(name: /project/i).first
  # => #<Band _id: 5dc9f7d5ce4ef34893354323, name: "Sun Project", description: "Sun\nProject">

It is also possible to query using PCRE syntax by constructing
``BSON::Regexp::Raw`` objects explicitly:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.where(description: /\AProject/).first
  # => #<Band _id: 5dc9f7d5ce4ef34893354323, name: "Sun Project", description: "Sun\nProject">

  Band.where(description: BSON::Regexp::Raw.new('^Project')).first
  # => nil

  Band.where(description: BSON::Regexp::Raw.new('^Project', 'm')).first
  # => #<Band _id: 5dc9f7d5ce4ef34893354323, name: "Sun Project", description: "Sun\nProject">


Queries + Persistence
=====================

Mongoid supports persistence operations off of criteria
in a light capacity for when you want to expressively perform multi
document inserts, updates, and deletion.

          Band.where(label: "Mute").destroy

Scoping
=======

Scopes provide a convenient way to reuse common criteria with more
business domain style syntax.

Named Scopes
------------

Named scopes are simply criteria defined at class load that are referenced
by a provided name. Just like normal criteria, they are lazy and chainable.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :country, type: String
    field :genres, type: Array

    scope :english, ->{ where(country: "England") }
    scope :rock, ->{ where(:genres.in => [ "rock" ]) }
  end

  Band.english.rock # Get the English rock bands.

Named scopes can take procs and blocks for accepting parameters or
extending functionality.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    field :country, type: String
    field :active, type: Boolean, default: true

    scope :named, ->(name){ where(name: name) }
    scope :active, ->{
      where(active: true) do
        def deutsch
          tap do |scope|
            scope.selector.store("origin" => "Deutschland")
          end
        end
      end
    }
  end

  Band.named("Depeche Mode") # Find Depeche Mode.
  Band.active.deutsch # Find active German bands.

By default, Mongoid allows defining a scope that would shadow an existing
class method, as the following example shows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Product
    include Mongoid::Document

    def self.fresh
      true
    end

    scope :fresh, ->{ where(fresh: true) }
  end

To have Mongoid raise an error when a scope would overwrite an existing class
method, set the ``scope_overwrite_exception`` :ref:`configuration option
<configuration-options>` to ``true``.

Default Scopes
--------------

Default scopes can be useful when you find yourself applying the same
criteria to most queries, and wish to specify these criteria as the default.
Default scopes are procs that return criteria objects.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    field :active, type: Boolean

    default_scope ->{ where(active: true) }
  end

  Band.each do |band|
    # All bands here are active.
  end

Specifying a default scope also initializes the fields of new models to
the values given in the default scope, if the values are simple literals:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    field :active, type: Boolean
    field :num_tours, type: Integer

    default_scope ->{ where(active: true, num_tours: {'$gt' => 1}) }
  end

  # active is set, num_tours is not set
  Band.new # => #<Band _id: 5c3f7452ce4ef378295ca5f5, name: nil, active: true, num_tours: nil>

Note that if a default value is provided both in the field definition and
in the default scope, the value in the default scope takes precedence:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    field :active, type: Boolean, default: true

    default_scope ->{ where(active: false) }
  end

  Band.new # => #<Band _id: 5c3f74ddce4ef3791abbb088, name: nil, active: false>

Because a default scope initializes fields in new models as just described,
defining a default scope with a dotted key and a simple literal value is
not possible:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    field :tags, type: Hash

    default_scope ->{ where('tags.foo' => 'bar') }
  end

  Band.create! # exception: BSON::String::IllegalKey ('tags.foo' is an illegal key in MongoDB. Keys may not start with '$' or contain a '.'.)

A workaround is to define the default scope as a complex query:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    field :tags, type: Hash

    default_scope ->{ where('tags.foo' => {'$eq' => 'bar'}) }
  end

  Band.create!(tags: {hello: 'world'})
  Band.create!(tags: {foo: 'bar'})
  Band.count # => 1

You can tell Mongoid not to apply the default scope by using
``unscoped``, which can be inline or take a block.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.unscoped.where(name: "Depeche Mode")
  Band.unscoped do
    Band.where(name: "Depeche Mode")
  end

You can also tell Mongoid to explicitly apply the default scope
again later to always ensure it's there.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.unscoped.where(name: "Depeche Mode").scoped

If you are using a default scope on a model that is part of an association,
you must reload the association to have scoping reapplied.
This is important to note if you change a value of a document in the association
that would affect its visibility within the scoped association.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Label
    include Mongoid::Document
    embeds_many :bands
  end

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :active, default: true
    embedded_in :label
    default_scope ->{ where(active: true) }
  end

  label.bands.push(band)
  label.bands # [ band ]
  band.update_attribute(:active, false)
  label.bands # [ band ] Must reload.
  label.reload.bands # []


Class Methods
-------------

Class methods on models that return criteria objects are also
treated like scopes, and can be chained as well.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    field :active, type: Boolean, default: true

    def self.active
      where(active: true)
    end
  end

  Band.active

Map/Reduce
==========

Mongoid provides a DSL around MongoDB's map/reduce framework, for performing
custom map/reduce jobs or simple aggregations.

Execution
---------

You can tell Mongoid off the class or a criteria to perform a map/reduce
by calling ``map_reduce`` and providing map and reduce javascript
functions.

.. code-block:: ruby

  map = %Q{
    function() {
      emit(this.name, { likes: this.likes });
    }
  }

  reduce = %Q{
    function(key, values) {
      var result = { likes: 0 };
      values.forEach(function(value) {
        result.likes += value.likes;
      });
      return result;
    }
  }

  Band.where(:likes.gt => 100).map_reduce(map, reduce).out(inline: 1)

Just like criteria, map/reduce calls are lazily evaluated. So nothing will
hit the database until you iterate over the results, or make a call on the
wrapper that would need to force a database hit.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.map_reduce(map, reduce).out(replace: "mr-results").each do |document|
    p document # { "_id" => "Tool", "value" => { "likes" => 200 }}
  end

The only required thing you provide along with a map/reduce is where to
output the results. If you do not provide this an error will be raised.
Valid options to ``#out`` are:

- ``inline: 1``: Don't store the output in a collection.
- ``replace: "name"``: Store in a collection with the
  provided name, and overwrite any documents that exist in it.
- ``merge: "name"``: Store in a collection with the
  provided name, and merge the results with the existing documents.
- ``reduce: "name"``: Store in a collection with the
  provided name, and reduce all existing results in that collection.

Raw Results
-----------

Results of Map/Reduce execution can be retrieved via the ``execute`` method
or its aliases ``raw`` and ``results``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  mr = Band.where(:likes.gt => 100).map_reduce(map, reduce).out(inline: 1)

  mr.execute
  # => {"results"=>[{"_id"=>"Tool", "value"=>{"likes"=>200.0}}],
        "timeMillis"=>14,
        "counts"=>{"input"=>4, "emit"=>4, "reduce"=>1, "output"=>1},
        "ok"=>1.0,
        "$clusterTime"=>{"clusterTime"=>#<BSON::Timestamp:0x00005633c2c2ad20 @seconds=1590105400, @increment=1>, "signature"=>{"hash"=><BSON::Binary:0x12240 type=generic data=0x0000000000000000...>, "keyId"=>0}},
        "operationTime"=>#<BSON::Timestamp:0x00005633c2c2aaf0 @seconds=1590105400, @increment=1>}


Statistics
----------

MongoDB servers 4.2 and lower provide Map/Reduce execution statistics. As of
MongoDB 4.4, Map/Reduce is implemented via the aggregation pipeline and
statistics described in this section are not available.

The following methods are provided on the ``MapReduce`` object:

- ``counts``: Number of documents read, emitted, reduced and output through
  the pipeline.
- ``input``, ``emitted``, ``reduced``, ``output``: individual count methods.
  Note that ``emitted`` and ``reduced`` methods are named differently from
  hash keys in ``counts``.
- ``time``: The time, in milliseconds, that Map/Reduce pipeline took to execute.

The following code illustrates retrieving the statistics:

.. code-block:: ruby

  mr = Band.where(:likes.gt => 100).map_reduce(map, reduce).out(inline: 1)

  mr.counts
  # => {"input"=>4, "emit"=>4, "reduce"=>1, "output"=>1}

  mr.input
  # => 4

  mr.emitted
  # => 4

  mr.reduced
  # => 1

  mr.output
  # => 1

  mr.time
  # => 14

.. note::

  Each statistics method invocation re-executes the Map/Reduce pipeline.
  The results of execution are not stored by Mongoid. Consider using the
  ``execute`` method to retrieve the raw results and obtaining the statistics
  from the raw results if multiple statistics are desired.


.. _text-search:

Text Search
===========

MongoDB provides :manual:`text indexes </core/index-text/>`
to support text search queries on string content. Text indexes
can include any field whose value is a string or an array of
string elements.

.. note::

  MongoDB Atlas also provides
  `Atlas Search <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/atlas-search/>`_
  which is a more powerful and flexible text search solution.
  The rest of this section discusses text indexes and not Atlas Search.

To perform text search with Mongoid, follow these steps:

1. Define a text index on a model.
2. Create the text index on the server.
3. Build a text search query.


Defining Text Search Index
--------------------------

Index definition through Mongoid is described in detail on the `indexes
<mongoid-indexes>`_ page. Text search indexes are described in detail
under `text indexes <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/index-text/>`_
in the MongoDB manual. Below is an example definition of a Band model with
a text index utilizing the description field:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :name, type: String
    field :description, type: String

    index description: 'text'
  end

Note that the index type (``text``) must be given as a string, not as a symbol.


Creating Text Index
-------------------

To create the index, invoke the ``db:mongoid:create_indexes`` Rake task:

.. code-block:: ruby

  bundle exec rake db:mongoid:create_indexes


Querying Using Text Index
-------------------------

To find bands whose description contains "ounces" or its variations, use the
`$text operator <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/text/#op._S_text>`_:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.where('$text' => {'$search' => 'ounces'}).to_a
  # => [#<Band _id: 5d5341b3ce4ef35d5016746d, name: "foo", description: "ounce">]

Note that the description contains the word "ounce" even though the search
query was "ounces".

Note also that when performing text search, the name of the field is not
explicitly specified - ``$text`` operator searches all fields indexed with
the text index.
