Mongoid supports all expected CRUD operations for those familiar with other
Ruby mappers like Active Record or Data Mapper. What distinguishes Mongoid
from other mappers for MongoDB is that the general persistence operations
perform atomic updates on only the fields that have changed instead of
writing the entire document to the database each time.

The persistence sections will provide examples on what database operation is
performed when executing the documented command.

Standard
--------

Mongoid's standard persistence methods come in the form of common methods you
would find in other mapping frameworks. The following table shows all standard
operations with examples.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 60

   * - Operation
     - Example

   * - ``Model.create!``

       *Insert a document or multiple documents into the database, raising an
       error if a validation or server error occurs.*
       
       *Pass a hash of attributes to create one document with the specified
       attributes, or an array of hashes to create multiple documents.
       If a single hash is passed, the corresponding document is returned.
       If an array of hashes is passed, an array of documents corresponding
       to the hashes is returned.*
       
       *If a block is given to* ``create!`` *, it will be invoked with each
       document as the argument in turn prior to attempting to save that
       document.*
       
       *If there is a problem saving any of the documents, such as
       a validation error or a server error, an exception is raised
       and, consequently, none of the documents are returned.
       However, if an array of hashes was passed and previous documents were
       successfully saved, those documents will remain in the database.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          Person.create!(
            first_name: "Heinrich",
            last_name: "Heine"
          ) # => Person instance

          Person.create!([
            { first_name: "Heinrich", last_name: "Heine" },
            { first_name: "Willy", last_name: "Brandt" }
          ]) # => Array of two Person instances

          Person.create!(first_name: "Heinrich") do |doc|
            doc.last_name = "Heine"
          end # => Person instance

   * - ``Model.create``

       *Instantiate a document or multiple documents and, if validations pass,
       insert them into the database.*
       
       ``create`` *is similar to* ``create!`` *but does not raise
       exceptions on validation errors. It still raises errors on server
       errors, such as trying to insert a document with an* ``_id`` *that
       already exists in the collection.*
       
       *If any validation errors are encountered, the respective document
       is not inserted but is returned along with documents that were inserted.
       Use* ``persisted?`` *,* ``new_record?`` *or* ``errors`` *methods
       to check which of the returned documents were inserted into the
       database.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          Person.create(
            first_name: "Heinrich",
            last_name: "Heine"
          ) # => Person instance

          Person.create([
            { first_name: "Heinrich", last_name: "Heine" },
            { first_name: "Willy", last_name: "Brandt" }
          ]) # => Array of two Person instances

          Person.create(first_name: "Heinrich") do |doc|
            doc.last_name = "Heine"
          end # => Person instance
          
          class Post
            include Mongoid::Document
            
            validates_uniqueness_of :title
          end
          
          posts = Post.create([{title: "test"}, {title: "test"}])
          # => array of two Post instances
          posts.map { |post| post.persisted? } # => [true, false]

   * - ``Model#save!``

       *Save the changed attributes to the database atomically, or insert the document if
       new. Raises an exception if validations fail or there is a server error.*
       
       *Returns true if the changed attributes were saved, raises an exception otherwise.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person = Person.new(
            first_name: "Heinrich",
            last_name: "Heine"
          )
          person.save!

          person.first_name = "Christian Johan"
          person.save!

   * - ``Model#save``

       *Save the changed attributes to the database atomically, or insert the document
       if new.*
       
       *Returns true if the changed attributes were saved. Returns false
       if there were any validation errors. Raises an exception if
       the document passed validation but there was a server error during
       the save.*
       
       *Pass* ``validate: false`` *option to bypass validations.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person = Person.new(
            first_name: "Heinrich",
            last_name: "Heine"
          )
          person.save
          person.save(validate: false)

          person.first_name = "Christian Johan"
          person.save

   * - ``Model#update_attributes``

       *Update the document attributes in the database. Will return true if validation passed,
       false if not.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.update_attributes(
            first_name: "Jean",
            last_name: "Zorg"
          )

   * - ``Model#update_attributes!``

       *Update the document attributes in the database and raise an error if validation failed.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.update_attributes!(
            first_name: "Leo",
            last_name: "Tolstoy"
          )

   * - ``Model#update_attribute``

       *Update a single attribute, bypassing validations.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.update_attribute(:first_name, "Jean")

   * - ``Model#upsert``

       *Performs a MongoDB upsert on the document. If the document exists in the database,
       it will get overwritten with the current attributes of the document in memory.
       If the document does not exist in the database, it will be inserted. Note that
       this only runs the* ``{before|after|around}_upsert`` *callbacks.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person = Person.new(
            first_name: "Heinrich",
            last_name: "Heine"
          )
          person.upsert

   * - ``Model#touch``

       *Update the document's updated_at timestamp, optionally with one extra
       provided time field. This will cascade the touch to all*
       ``belongs_to`` *associations of the document with the option set.
       This operation skips validations and callbacks.*
       
       *Attempting to touch a destroyed document will raise* ``FrozenError``
       * (as of Ruby 2.5,* ``RuntimeError`` *on previous Ruby versions),
       same as if attempting to update an attribute on a destroyed
       document.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.touch
          person.touch(:audited_at)

   * - ``Model#delete``

       *Deletes the document from the database without running callbacks.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.delete

   * - ``Model#destroy``

       *Deletes the document from the database while running destroy callbacks.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.destroy

   * - ``Model.delete_all``

       *Deletes all documents from the database without running any callbacks.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          Person.delete_all

   * - ``Model.destroy_all``

       *Deletes all documents from the database while running callbacks. This is a
       potentially expensive operation since all documents will be loaded into memory.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          Person.destroy_all

Mongoid provides the following persistence-related attributes:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 60

   * - Attribute
     - Example


   * - ``Model#new_record?``

       *Returns* ``true`` *if the model instance has not yet been saved
       to the database. Opposite of* ``persisted?``
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person = Person.new(
            first_name: "Heinrich",
            last_name: "Heine"
          )
          person.new_record? # => true
          person.save!
          person.new_record? # => false

   * - ``Model#persisted?``

       *Returns* ``true`` *if the model instance has been saved
       to the database. Opposite of* ``new_record?``
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person = Person.new(
            first_name: "Heinrich",
            last_name: "Heine"
          )
          person.persisted? # => false
          person.save!
          person.persisted? # => true



Atomic
------

Although Mongoid performs atomic operations under the covers by default,
there may be cases where you want to do this explicitly without persisting
other fields. Mongoid provides support for all of these operations as well.
When executing atomic operations via these methods, callbacks and validations
are not invoked.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 60

   * - Operation
     - Example

   * - ``Model#add_to_set``

       *Performs an atomic $addToSet on the field.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.add_to_set(aliases: "Bond")

   * - ``Model#bit``

       *Performs an atomic $bit on the field.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.bit(age: { and: 10, or: 12 })

   * - ``Model#inc``

       *Performs an atomic $inc on the field.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.inc(age: 1)

   * - ``Model#pop``

       *Performs an atomic $pop on the field.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.pop(aliases: 1)

   * - ``Model#pull``

       *Performs an atomic $pull on the field.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.pull(aliases: "Bond")

   * - ``Model#pull_all``

       *Performs an atomic $pullAll on the field.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.pull_all(aliases: [ "Bond", "James" ])

   * - ``Model#push``

       *Performs an atomic $push on the field.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.push(aliases: ["007","008"])

   * - ``Model#rename``

       *Performs an atomic $rename on the field.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.rename(bday: :dob)

   * - ``Model#set``

       *Updates an attribute on the model instance and, if the instance
       is already persisted, performs an atomic $set on the field, bypassing
       validations.*
       
       ``set`` *can also deeply set values on Hash fields.*
       
       ``set`` *can also deeply set values on* ``embeds_one`` *associations.
       If such an association's document is nil, one will be created prior
       to the update.*

       ``set`` *should not be used with* ``has_one`` *associations, as it
       does not correctly work in such cases.*

     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person = Person.create!(name: "Ricky Bobby")
          person.set(name: "Tyler Durden") # updates name in the database


    	  person = Person.new
          person.set(name: "Tyler Durden") # does not write to database
    	  person.name # => "Tyler Durden"
    	  person.persisted? # => true


    	  class Post

          post.metadata['published_at'] # => Time instance
          
          post.set('metadata.approved.today' => true)
          post.metadata['approved'] # => {'today' => true}


          class Flight
            include Mongoid::Document

            embeds_one :plan
          end

          class Plan
            include Mongoid::Document

            embedded_in :flight

            field :route, type: String
          end
          
          flight = Flight.create!
          flight.plan # => nil
          flight.set('plan.route', 'test route')
          flight.plan # => Plan instance
          flight.plan.route # => "test route"


   * - ``Model#unset``

       *Performs an atomic $unset on the field.*
     -
        .. code-block:: ruby

          person.unset(:name)

.. _atomic-operation-grouping:

Atomic Operation Grouping
*************************

Atomic operations may be grouped together using the ``#atomically`` method
on a document. All operations inside the block given to ``#atomically``
are sent to the cluster in a single atomic command. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  person.atomically do
    person.inc(age: 1)
    person.set(name: 'Jake')
  end

``#atomically`` blocks may be nested. The default behavior is to write
changes performed by each block as soon as the block ends:

.. code-block:: ruby

  person.atomically do
    person.atomically do
      person.inc(age: 1)
      person.set(name: 'Jake')
    end
    raise 'An exception'
    # name and age changes are still persisted
  end

This behavior can be changed by specifying the ``join_context: true`` option
to ``#atomically``, or globally by setting the ``join_contexts``
:ref:`configuration option <configuration-options>` to ``true``. When
context joining is enabled, nested ``#atomically`` blocks are joined with
the outer blocks, and only the outermost block (or the first block where
``join_contexts`` is false) actually writes changes to the cluster.
For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  person.atomically do
    person.atomically(join_context: true) do
      person.inc(age: 1)
      person.set(name: 'Jake')
    end
    raise 'An exception'
    # name and age changes are not persisted
  end

The context joining behavior can be enabled globally by default by setting
``join_context`` option in Mongoid configuration. In this case specifying
``join_context: false`` on an ``#atomically`` block can be used to
obtain the independent persistence context behavior.

If an exception is raised in an ``#atomically`` block which has not yet
persisted its changes to the cluster, any pending attribute changes on
Mongoid models are reverted. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  person = Person.new(name: 'Tom')
  begin
    person.atomically do
      person.inc(age: 1)
      person.set(name: 'Jake')
      person.name # => 'Jake'
      raise 'An exception'
    end
  rescue Exception
    person.name # => 'Tom'
  end

Atomic operations described in this section apply to one document at a time,
therefore nesting ``#atomically`` blocks invoked on multiple documents does
not make changes to the different documents be persisted atomically together.
However, MongoDB offers :ref:`multi-document transactions <transactions>`
as of server version 4.0 which provide atomic persistence across multiple
documents.

Custom
------

There may be cases where you want to persist documents to different sources from their
defaults, or with different options from the default. Mongoid provides run-time support
for this as well as support on a per-model basis.

Model Level Persistence Options
*******************************

On a per-model basis, you can tell it to store in a custom collection name, a different
database, or a different client. The following example would store the Band class by
default into a collection named "artists" in the database named "music", with the client "secondary".

Note that the value supplied to the ``client`` option must be configured under ``clients``
in your mongoid.yml.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    store_in collection: "artists", database: "music", client: "secondary"
  end

If no ``store_in`` macro would have been provided, Mongoid would store the model in a
collection named "bands" in the default database in the default client.

Runtime Persistence Options
***************************

You can change at runtime where to store, query, update, or remove documents by prefixing
any operation with ``#with`` and passing a block.

.. code-block:: ruby

   Band.with(database: "music-non-stop") do |klass|
     klass.create
   end
   Band.with(collection: "artists") do |klass|
     klass.delete_all
   end
   band.with(client: :tertiary) do |band_object|
     band_object.save!
   end

Persisting using with is a one-time switch in the persistence context - it creates a new
client under the covers which will get closed and garbage collected after use. Mongoid will not remember
anything specific on the document level regarding how it was saved when using this method.
A potential gotcha with this is persisting a document via with and then immediately updating it after.

.. code-block:: ruby

   band = Band.new(name: "Scuba")
   band.with(collection: "artists") do |band_object|
     band_object.save!
   end
   band.update_attribute(likes: 1000) # This will not save - queries the collection "bands"
   band.with(collection: "artists") do |band_object|
     band_object.update_attribute(likes: 1000) # This will update the document.
   end

The Mongoid API was changed in version 6.0 to always require that a block be passed to #with. This is because
a new client is created under the covers with the options passed to #with. A new client may spin up new
monitor threads for keeping track of the MongoDB cluster, depending on what options are specified. This may in
turn cause the number of connections to continually grow with each use of #with. Now that a block is required,
Mongoid can properly stop the monitor threads and close the client after the block is called.

If you want to switch the persistence context for all operations at runtime, but don't want
to be using with all over your code, Mongoid provides the ability to do this as the client
and database level globally. The methods for this are ``Mongoid.override_client`` and
``Mongoid.override_database``. A useful case for this are internationalized applications
that store information for different locales in different databases or clients, but the
schema in each remains the same.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class BandsController < ApplicationController
    before_filter :switch_database
    after_filter :reset_database

    private

    def switch_database
      I18n.locale = params[:locale] || I18n.default_locale
      Mongoid.override_database("my_db_name_#{I18n.locale}")
    end

    def reset_database
      Mongoid.override_database(nil)
    end
  end

In the above example, all persistence operations would be stored in the alternative
database for all remaining operations on this thread. This is why the after request
set the override back to nil - it ensures subsequent requests with no local params
use the default option.

Persistence context applies to both read and write operations. For example,
secondary reads can be performed as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.with(read: {mode: :secondary}) do
    Band.count
  end

Client and Collection Access
****************************

If you want to drop down to the driver level to perform operations, you can grab
the Mongo client or collection from the model or document instance.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.mongo_client
  band.mongo_client
  Band.collection
  band.collection

From here you also have the same runtime persistence options using the client's ``#with``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  client = Band.mongo_client.with(write: { w: 0 }, database: "musik")
  client[:artists].find(...)

You can also override the :read or :write options on the collection using the collections ``#with``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  collection_w_0 = Band.collection.with(write: { w: 0 })
  collection_w_0[:artists].find(...)

Capped Collections
******************

Mongoid does not provide a mechanism for creating capped collections on the fly - you
will need to create these yourself one time up front either with the driver or via the
Mongo console.

To create a capped collection with the driver:

.. code-block:: ruby

  client["name", :capped => true, :size => 1024].create

To create a capped collection from the Mongo console:

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.createCollection("name", { capped: true, size: 1024 });

Set a Default Collation on a Collection
***************************************

Mongoid does not provide a mechanism for creating a collection with a default collation.
Like capped collections, you will need to create the collection yourself one time, up-front,
either with the driver or via the Mongo console.

To create a collection with a default collation with the driver:

.. code-block:: ruby

  client["name", :collation => { :locale => 'fr'}].create

To create a collection with a default collation from the Mongo console:

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.createCollection("name", { collation: { locale: 'fr' } });
