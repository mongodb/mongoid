Contributing Guidelines
=======================

When contributing code to Mongoid, the following guildelines should be followed:

#. Create a fork of Mongoid.
#. Create a new branch in that fork.
#. Make your changes.
#. Ensure that the proposed changes have adequate test coverage.
#. Raise a PR against Mongoid master. If these changes correspond to a specific
   Jira ticket, title the PR: "MONGOID-<ticket #> Description of Changes".
#. The Mongoid team will review the PR and make comments/suggest changes.
#. Once all of the changes and fixes are made, and the Mongoid team determine
   the PR fit for merging, we will merge the PR into master and determine
   whether it needs to be backported.
#. Backports to 7.3-present are done if the change is a bug fix, is not backwards
   breaking, and if the commit is applicable to the corresponding stable branch.
#. Changes to 6.0-7.2 are generally not made unless it fixes a security
   vulnerability.
#. 5.x and earlier is generally not supported.
