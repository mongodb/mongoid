Embedded Document Matching
--------------------------

**Breaking change:** In Mongoid 7.2 :ref:`embedded matchers <embedded-matching>`
were largely rewritten. Most queries should produce the same results as in
previous versions of Mongoid but a number of cases changed behavior to make
Mongoid behave the same way MongoDB server behaves. Note that the changes,
for the most part, affect queries using manually constructed MQL expressions;
Mongoid query methods generate MQL that is generally not affected by the
changes in embedded matching.

To illustrate the differences, the examples below use the following model
definitions:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Job
    include Mongoid::Document

    embeds_many :tasks
  end

  class Task
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Mongoid::Attributes::Dynamic

    embedded_in :job
  end

  job = Job.new(tasks: [
    Task.new(name: 'Clean house', pattern: /test/, hours: 12),
  ])

The changes in behavior are as follows:

``$eq`` and Regular Expression Values
`````````````````````````````````````

``$eq`` now performs exact matching when given regular a expression argument.
Previously, both operators used regular expression matching, which caused
Mongoid to not find documents where the field being matched was a regular
expression itself:

.. code-block:: ruby

  job.tasks.where(name: {'$eq': /house/}).first
  # Mongoid 7.2:
  # => nil
  # Mongoid 7.1:
  # => #<Task _id: 5ef8dc3e2c97a645ec86bb33, name: "Clean house", pattern: /test/, hours: 12>

  job.tasks.where(pattern: {'$eq': /test/}).first
  # Mongoid 7.2:
  # => #<Task _id: 5ef8dc3e2c97a645ec86bb33, name: "Clean house", pattern: /test/, hours: 12>
  # Mongoid 7.1:
  # => nil

To perform a regular expression match, provide the regular expression directly
without an operator:

.. code-block:: ruby

  job.tasks.where(name: /house/).first
  # Mongoid 7.2 and 7.1:
  # => #<Task _id: 5ef8dc3e2c97a645ec86bb33, name: "Clean house", pattern: /test/, hours: 12>

``$ne`` and Regular Expression Values
`````````````````````````````````````

``$ne`` no longer accepts regular expression arguments, which is the behavior
of MongoDB server:

.. code-block:: ruby

  job.tasks.where(name: {'$ne': /apartment/}).first
  # Mongoid 7.2: raises Mongoid::Errors::InvalidQuery
  # Mongoid 7.1:
  # => #<Task _id: 5ef8dc3e2c97a645ec86bb33, name: "Clean house", pattern: /test/, hours: 12>

To perform a negated regular expression match, use the ``not`` method on a
symbol key:

.. code-block:: ruby

  job.tasks.where(:name.not => /house/).first
  # Mongoid 7.2 and 7.1:
  # => nil
  job.tasks.where(:name.not => /office/).first
  # Mongoid 7.2 and 7.1:
  # => #<Task _id: 5ef8dc3e2c97a645ec86bb33, name: "Clean house", pattern: /test/, hours: 12>

``$eq``, ``$ne`` and Range Values
`````````````````````````````````

Range values are no longer accepted by ``$eq`` and ``$ne`` operators.
This change should not be visible to applications since Mongoid generally
expands Range values to a ``$gte``/``$lte`` pair before they get to the
embedded matchers.

To query using a range, use the following syntax which works in Mongoid 7.2
as well as previous versions:

.. code-block:: ruby

  job.tasks.where(hours: 10..15)
  # =>
  # #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {"hours"=>{"$gte"=>10, "$lte"=>15}}
  #   options:  {}
  #   class:    Task
  #   embedded: true>

  job.tasks.where(hours: 10..15).first
  # => #<Task _id: 5ef8dd4c2c97a6465e8a4ffa, name: "Clean house", pattern: /test/, hours: 12>

Mongoid 7.1 accepted Range values as operator arguments, but generated
queries that would never match documents. For example, the following
expression was accepted but never matched any documents:

.. code-block:: ruby

  job.tasks.where(hours: {'$in': 10..15})
  # =>
  # #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {"hours"=>{:$in=>{"$gte"=>10, "$lte"=>15}}}
  #   options:  {}
  #   class:    Task
  #   embedded: true>

Mongoid 7.2 raises ``Mongoid::Errors::InvalidQuery`` in this case.

``$elemMatch``
``````````````

``$elemMatch`` now supports specifying operators as top-level fields:

.. code-block:: ruby

  mixed_tasks_job = Job.new(tasks: [
    Task.new(name: 'Clean house', hours: 12, supplies: [{broom: 1}]),
    Task.new(name: 'Clean office', hours: [8, 16]),
  ])

  mixed_tasks_job.tasks.where(hours: {'$elemMatch': {'$lt': 20}}).first
  # Mongoid 7.2:
  # => #<Task _id: 5ef8c7202c97a6465e8a4ff3, name: "Clean office", hours: [8, 16]>
  # Mongoid 7.1: error

Implicit matching under ``$elemMatch`` has been fixed and now works:

.. code-block:: ruby

  mixed_tasks_job.tasks.where(supplies: {'$elemMatch': {broom: 1}}).first
  # Mongoid 7.2:
  # => #<Task _id: 5ef8c9162c97a6465e8a4ff6, name: "Clean house", hours: 12, supplies: [{:broom=>1}]>
  # Mongoid 7.1:
  # => nil

For compatibility with MongoDB server, ``$elemMatch`` requires a ``Hash``
argument. Use ``$eq`` or ``$regex`` to perform equality comparisons or
regular expression matches, respectively:

.. code-block:: ruby

  mixed_tasks_job.tasks.where(hours: {'$elemMatch': 8}).first
  # Mongoid 7.2: raises Mongoid::Errors::InvalidQuery
  # Mongoid 7.1:
  # => nil

  mixed_tasks_job.tasks.where(hours: {'$elemMatch': {'$eq': 8}}).first
  # Mongoid 7.2:
  # => #<Task _id: 5ef8ca0b2c97a6465e8a4ff9, name: "Clean office", hours: [8, 16]>
  # Mongoid 7.1: error

``$and``, ``$nor``, ``$or`` and Empty Argument Arrays
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````

``$and``, ``$nor`` and ``$or`` operators now raise an exception when given
empty arrays as arguments. This only applies to raw MQL query expressions;
the corresponding Mongoid :ref:`query methods <logical-operations>`
continue to permit being called without arguments. In previous versions
of Mongoid, ``$and`` would match when given an empty array of conditions
and ``$nor`` and ``$or`` would not match when given empty arrays of
conditions.

.. code-block:: ruby

  job.tasks.where('$and': []).first
  # Mongoid 7.2: raises Mongoid::Errors::InvalidQuery
  # Mongoid 7.1:
  # => #<Task _id: 5ef8dc3e2c97a645ec86bb33, name: "Clean house", pattern: /test/, hours: 12>

  job.tasks.where('$nor': []).first
  # Mongoid 7.2: raises Mongoid::Errors::InvalidQuery
  # Mongoid 7.1:
  # => nil

  job.tasks.where('$or': []).first
  # Mongoid 7.2: raises Mongoid::Errors::InvalidQuery
  # Mongoid 7.1:
  # => nil

  job.tasks.and.first
  # Mongoid 7.2 and 7.1:
  # => #<Task _id: 5ef8dc3e2c97a645ec86bb33, name: "Clean house", pattern: /test/, hours: 12>

  job.tasks.nor.first
  # Mongoid 7.2 and 7.1:
  # => #<Task _id: 5ef8dc3e2c97a645ec86bb33, name: "Clean house", pattern: /test/, hours: 12>

  job.tasks.or.first
  # Mongoid 7.2 and 7.1:
  # => #<Task _id: 5ef8dc3e2c97a645ec86bb33, name: "Clean house", pattern: /test/, hours: 12>


``count`` and ``estimated_count`` Methods
-----------------------------------------

Minor change: the ``count`` method on model classes and ``Criteria`` objects
is now using the ``count_documents`` driver helper. This makes ``count``
seamlessly work in transactions.

Model classes now also have the ``estimated_count`` method to obtain an
approximate number of documents in the collection. This method is roughly
equivalent to the ``count`` method in Mongoid 7.1 and earlier, except
``estimated_count`` does not accept filter conditions.

The new behavior is further described in the :ref:`Additional Query Methods
<additional-query-methods>` section.


``any?`` on ``has_many`` Associations
-------------------------------------

Minor change: the :ref:`any? method on has_many associations <has-many-any>`
was optimized to only retrieve the _id field when querying the database,
instead of loading the entire association.


``StringifiedSymbol`` Field Type
--------------------------------

New feature: the :ref:`StringifiedSymbol field type <stringified-symbol>`
was added for storing Ruby symbol values in MongoDB in a manner interoperable
with other programming languages.


Changing the Discriminator Key
------------------------------

New feature: Mongoid now supports :ref:`changing the default discriminator key
<discriminator-key>` from the default ``_type`` when using inheritance.
This can be done by setting the ``discriminator_key`` field on the parent class
or globally. To set the discriminator key on the parent class:

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Shape
     include Mongoid::Document

     self.discriminator_key = "shape_type"
   end

   class Circle < Shape
   end

   class Rectangle < Shape
   end

To set the discriminator key globally:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Mongoid.discriminator_key = "global_discriminator"

   class Shape
     include Mongoid::Document
   end

   class Circle < Shape
   end

   class Rectangle < Shape
   end


Changing the Discriminator Value
--------------------------------

New feature: Mongoid now also supports :ref:`changing the discriminator value
<discriminator-value>` from the default value, which is the class name.
The discriminator value can be changed by setting the ``discriminator_value``
on that class:

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Shape
     include Mongoid::Document
   end

   class Circle < Shape
     self.discriminator_value = "round thing"
   end

   class Rectangle < Shape
   end


Shard Key Used For Reloading
----------------------------

Minor change: When sharding is used, Mongoid 7.2 expects the shard key declared
in models to match the shard key in the database for the respective collections.
In Mongoid 7.2 model reloading (either explicit via the ``reload`` method
or implicit as part of persistence operations) uses the shard key, if one is
defined, in the ``find`` command in addition to the ``id`` field value.
This improves the performance of document reloading, and consequently some
persistence operations, in sharded clusters, especially those with
`geographically distributed shards
<https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/global-clusters/>`_.

Consider a class ``Band`` whose documents are sharded by the ``name`` key.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String

    shard_key :name
  end

Example Mongoid 7.2 behavior:

.. code-block:: ruby

  band = Band.create(name: "Destiny's Child")
  band.reload
  # Command logs: { "find"=>"bands", "filter"=>{ "_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('...') "name"=>"Destiny's Child" } }

Example Mongoid 7.1 behavior:

.. code-block:: ruby

  band = Band.create(name: "Destiny's Child")
  band.reload
  # Command logs: { "find"=>"bands", "filter"=>{"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('...') } }

Mongoid provides :ref:`sharding management Rake tasks <sharding-management>`
to shard collections according to shard keys declared in models.


Query Cache Moved to Driver
---------------------------

Minor change: Ruby driver version 2.14.0 implements a new and improved query
cache. When using driver version 2.14.0 or newer, Mongoid will use the driver's
query cache to cache query results.

The driver query cache introduces the following improvements:

* Caching multi-batch query results
* Taking a query's read concern and read preference into account when deciding
  when to return cached results
* Invalidating the cache after bulk write operations and aggregation operations
  with ``$out`` and ``$merge`` pipeline stages
* Invalidating the cache after transaction commit and abort operations
* Improved performance of queries with limits
* Caching aggregation results
* More efficient query cache invalidation

Mongoid's query cache, which will now be referred to as the "legacy query cache,"
has been deprecated. Mongoid will retain the legacy query cache for use with
older versions of the driver.

The interface for enabling and disabling the query cache in Mongoid has not
changed. When using driver versions 2.14.0 and newer, this interface will
enable or disable the query cache in the driver.

The driver query cache is more correct and more effective than the legacy
Mongoid query cache. If you plan to use the query cache, it is recommended
that you upgrade to driver version 2.14.

To read more about the query cache improvements made in the driver, see
`the Ruby driver documentation <https://mongodb.com/docs/ruby-driver/current/reference/query-cache/>`_.

To read more about using the query cache with Mongoid and the limitations
of the legacy query cache, see :ref:`the query cache documentation <query-cache>`.


``Regexp`` Fields Store Assigned Strings As Regular Expressions
---------------------------------------------------------------

Minor change: when a ``String`` value is written in a ``Regexp`` field,
Mongoid 7.2 stores that value in MongoDB as a regular expression.
Subsequently it would be retrieved :ref:`as a BSON::Regexp::Raw instance
<regular-expression-fields>`.
Previously the value would be stored as a string and would be retrieved as
a string.

Example Mongoid 7.2 behavior:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Offer
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :constraint, type: Regexp
  end

  offer = Offer.create!(constraint: /foo/)
  # => #<Offer _id: 6082df412c97a66be6ba9970, constraint: /foo/>

  Offer.collection.aggregate([
    {'$match' => {_id: offer.id}},
    {'$set' => {type: {'$type' => '$constraint'}}},
  ]).first
  # => {"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('6082df412c97a66be6ba9970'),
  #     "constraint"=>#<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x000055b4ccdff738 @pattern="foo", @options="m">,
  #     "type"=>"regex"}

  offer = Offer.create!(constraint: 'foo')
  # => #<Offer _id: 6082df412c97a66be6ba9971, constraint: /foo/>

  Offer.collection.aggregate([
    {'$match' => {_id: offer.id}},
    {'$set' => {type: {'$type' => '$constraint'}}},
  ]).first
  # => {"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('6082df412c97a66be6ba9971'),
  #     "constraint"=>#<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x000055b4cce11320 @pattern="foo", @options="m">,
  #     "type"=>"regex"}

Mongoid 7.1 behavior with the same model class:

.. code-block:: ruby

  offer = Offer.create!(constraint: /foo/)
  # => #<Offer _id: 6082e0182c97a66c21e3f721, constraint: /foo/>

  Offer.collection.aggregate([
    {'$match' => {_id: offer.id}},
    {'$set' => {type: {'$type' => '$constraint'}}},
  ]).first
  # => {"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('6082e0182c97a66c21e3f721'),
  #     "constraint"=>#<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x000055ecf43f4cb0 @pattern="foo", @options="m">,
  #     "type"=>"regex"}

  offer = Offer.create!(constraint: 'foo')
  # => #<Offer _id: 6082e05c2c97a66c21e3f723, constraint: "foo">

  Offer.collection.aggregate([
    {'$match' => {_id: offer.id}},
    {'$set' => {type: {'$type' => '$constraint'}}},
  ]).first
  # => {"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('6082e05c2c97a66c21e3f723'),
  #     "constraint"=>"foo",
  #     "type"=>"string"}
