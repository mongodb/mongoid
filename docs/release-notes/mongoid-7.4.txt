This page describes significant changes and improvements in Mongoid 7.4.
The complete list of releases is available `on GitHub

<https://jira.mongodb.org/projects/MONGOID?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:release-page>`_;
please consult GitHub releases for detailed release notes and JIRA for
the complete list of issues fixed in each release, including bug fixes.


Ruby Version Support
--------------------

As of version 7.4, Mongoid supports Ruby 2.5+.
Support for Ruby 2.4 and earlier has been dropped.


``===`` Operator Matches Ruby Semantics
---------------------------------------

**Breaking change:** In Mongoid 7.4, the ``===`` operator works the same way
as it does in Ruby, and is equivalent to calling ``is_a?`` on the right hand
side with the left hand side as the argument:

.. code-block:: ruby

  ModelClass === instance

  # equivalent to:
  instance.is_a?(ModelClass)

Previously, ``===`` returned ``true`` for some cases when the equivalent Ruby
``===`` implementation returned false.

.. note::

  In order to get this functionality, the ``Mongoid.triple_equals_uses_is_a``
  global flag must be set to true. If it is set to false, the ``===`` operator
  will function as it did in Mongoid 7.3.

Mongoid 7.4 behavior:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
  end

  class CoverBand < Band
  end

  band = Band.new
  cover_band = CoverBand.new

  band === Band
  # => false

  cover_band === Band
  # => false

  Band === Band
  # => false

  CoverBand === Band
  # => false

Mongoid 7.3 behavior:

.. code-block:: ruby

  band === Band
  # => true

  cover_band === Band
  # => true

  Band === Band
  # => true

  CoverBand === Band
  # => true

The standard invocation of ``===``, that is having the class on the left and
the instance on the right, works the same in Mongoid 7.4 as it did previously
and matches the core Ruby behavior:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band === band
  # => true

  Band === cover_band
  # => true


``BSON::ObjectId#as_json`` Implementation Removed
-------------------------------------------------

Mongoid in versions up to 7.3 used to provide a ``BSON::ObjectId#as_json``
implementation that was identical to the one provided by ``bson-ruby``.
Mongoid 7.4 removes its copy of this implementation.

This change has no immediate impact on applications - ``BSON::ObjectId#as_json``
behaves the same in Mongoid 7.4 as it did in Mongoid 7.3. However, if
this implementation is changed in a future version of ``bson-ruby``
which is `under consideration <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-5158>`_,
Mongoid 7.4 and later will inherit the new implementation provided by
``bson-ruby`` while Mongoid 7.3 and earlier will continue with the
implementation returning a hash of ``{"$oid" => "..."}``.

..  note::

  In order to get this functionality, the ``Mongoid.use_bson_ruby_as_json``
  feature flag must be turned on.

Scoped Associations
-------------------

Associations now support the ``:scope`` argument, yielding
:ref:`scoped associations <association-scope>`.


``distinct`` and ``pluck`` Respect Field Aliases In Embedded Documents
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When ``distinct`` and ``pluck`` are used with aliased fields in embedded
documents, the aliases are now expanded. Given the following definitions:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    embeds_many :managers
  end

  class Manager
    include Mongoid::Document
    embedded_in :band

    field :name, as: :n
  end

Mongoid 7.4 behavior:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Expands out to "managers.name" in the query:
  Band.distinct('managers.n')
  Band.pluck('managers.n')

Mongoid 7.3 behavior:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Sends "managers.n" without expanding the alias:
  Band.distinct('managers.n')
  Band.pluck('managers.n')

Note that the alias expansion for top-level fields has already been
done by Mongoid 7.3.


``count``, ``sum``, ``avg``, ``min``, ``max`` Ignore Sort If Not Limiting/Skipping
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ``count``, ``sum``, ``avg``, ``min`` and ``max`` methods now omit the
sort stage from the generated aggregation pipeline if no skip or limit
is specified, because the results aren't affected by the sort order.
Example call that will now omit the sort stage and would potentially use
an index where it wouldn't before:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.desc(:name).count
