Added ``attribute_before_last_save``, ``saved_change_to_attribute``, ``saved_change_to_attribute?``, and ``will_save_change_to_attribute?``  methods
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These new methods behave identically to corresponding methods
from ``ActiveRecord::AttributeMethods::Dirty``. The methods are particularly useful in
callbacks:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :name, type: String

    before_save do
      puts "attribute_was(:name): #{attribute_was(:name)}"
      puts "attribute_before_last_save(:name): #{attribute_before_last_save(:name)}"
      puts "will_save_change_to_attribute?(:name): #{will_save_change_to_attribute?(:name)}"
    end

    after_save do
      puts "attribute_was(:name): #{attribute_was(:name)}"
      puts "attribute_before_last_save(:name): #{attribute_before_last_save(:name)}"
      puts "saved_change_to_attribute(:name): #{saved_change_to_attribute(:name)}"
      puts "attribute_changed?(:name): #{attribute_changed?(:name)}"
      puts "saved_change_to_attribute?(:name): #{saved_change_to_attribute?(:name)}"
    end
  end

  person = Person.create(name: 'John')
  #
  # before_save
  #
  ## attribute_was(:name): nil
  ## attribute_before_last_save(:name): nil
  ## will_save_change_to_attribute?(:name): true
  #
  # after_save
  #
  ## attribute_was(:name): John => New value
  ## attribute_before_last_save(:name): nil => Value before save
  ## saved_change_to_attribute(:name): [nil, "John"] => Both values
  ## attribute_changed?(:name): false
  ## saved_change_to_attribute?(:name): true => Correctly indicates that the change for :name was saved

  person.name = 'Jane'
  person.save
  #
  # before_save
  #
  ## attribute_was(:name): John => attribute_was not look back before the last save
  ## attribute_before_last_save(:name): nil => value before the last save
  ## will_save_change_to_attribute?(:name): true
  #
  # after_save
  #
  ## attribute_was(:name): Jane => New value
  ## attribute_before_last_save(:name): John => Value before save
  ## saved_change_to_attribute(:name): ["John", "Jane"] => Both values
  ## attribute_changed?(:name): false
  ## saved_change_to_attribute?(:name): true => Correctly indicates that the change for :name was saved

For all of the new methods there are also shorter forms created dynamically, e.g.
``attribute_before_last_save(:name)`` is equivalent to ``name_before_last_save``,
``saved_change_to_attribute(:name)`` is equivalent to ``saved_change_to_name``,
``saved_change_to_attribute?(:name)`` is equivalent to ``saved_change_to_name?``,
and ``will_save_change_to_attribute?(:name)`` is equivalent to ``will_save_change_to_name?``.


Configuration DSL No Longer Requires an Argument to its Block
-------------------------------------------------------------

It is now possible to use ``Mongoid.configure`` without
providing an argument to its block:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongoid.configure do
    connect_to("mongoid_test")

    # Use config method when assigning variables
    config.preload_models = true

Note that ``configure`` will continue to support a block argument.
The following is equivalent to the above:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongoid.configure do |config|
    config.connect_to("mongoid_test")

    config.preload_models = true


Added ``Mongoid::Criteria`` finder methods
------------------------------------------

Mongoid 8.1 implements several finder methods on ``Mongoid::Criteria``:

- ``first!``
- ``last!``
- ``second/second!``
- ``third/third!``
- ``fourth/fourth!``
- ``fifth/fifth!``
- ``second_to_last/second_to_last!``
- ``third_to_last/third_to_last!``

When no documents are found, methods without a bang (!) return nil, and methods
with a bang (!) raise an error:

.. code:: ruby

  Band.none.first
  # => nil

  Band.none.first!
  # => raise Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound


Added ``:touch`` option to ``#save``
------------------------------------

Support for the ``:touch`` option has been added to the ``#save`` and ``#save!``
methods. When this option is false, the ``updated_at`` field on the saved
document and all of it's embedded documents will not be updated with the
current time. When this option is true or unset, the ``updated_at`` field will
be updated with the current time.

If the document being saved is a new document (i.e. it has not yet been
persisted to the database), then the ``:touch`` option will be ignored, and the
``updated_at`` (and ``created_at``) fields will be updated with the current
time.


Added Version Based Default Configuration
-----------------------------------------

Mongoid 8.1 has added the ability to set the default configurations for a
specific version:

.. code:: ruby

  Mongoid.configure do |config|
    config.load_defaults 8.0
  end

This is helpful for upgrading between versions. See the section on
:ref:`Version Based Default Configuration <load-defaults>` for more details on
how to use this feature to make upgrading between Mongoid versions easier.


Added ``:present`` option to localized fields
---------------------------------------------

The ``:present`` option was added to localized fields for removing blank values
from the ``_translations`` hash:

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Product
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :description, localize: :present
   end

See the section on :ref:`Localize :present Field Option <present-fields>` for
more details on how these are used.


Added ``:to`` and ``:from`` options to ``attribute_changed?``
-------------------------------------------------------------

Mongoid 8.1 adds the ``:to`` and ``:from`` options on the ``attribute_changed?``
method. These options can be used to inquire whether the attribute has been changed
to or from a certain value:

.. code:

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
  end

  person = Person.create!(name: "Trout")
  person.name = "Ohtani"

  person.name_changed?
  # => true
  person.name_changed?(from: "Trout")
  # => true
  person.name_changed?(to: "Ohtani")
  # => true
  person.name_changed?(from: "Trout", to: "Ohtani")
  # => true
  person.name_changed?(from: "Trout", to: "Fletcher")
  # => false


Allowed ``store_in`` to be called on subclasses
-----------------------------------------------

Starting in Mongoid 8.1, subclasses can now specify which collection its
documents should be stored in using the ``store_in`` macro:

.. code:: ruby

  class Shape
    include Mongoid::Document
    store_in collection: :shapes
  end

  class Circle < Shape
    store_in collection: :circles
  end

  class Square < Shape
    store_in collection: :squares
  end

Previously, an error was raised if this was done. See the section on
:ref:`Inheritance Persistence Context <inheritance-persistence-context>`
for more details.


Added ``readonly!`` method and ``legacy_readonly`` feature flag
---------------------------------------------------------------

Mongoid 8.1 changes the meaning of read-only documents. In Mongoid 8.1 with 
this feature flag turned off, a document becomes read-only when calling the 
``readonly!`` method:

.. code:: ruby

  band = Band.first
  band.readonly? # => false
  band.readonly!
  band.readonly? # => true
  band.name = "The Rolling Stones"
  band.save # => raises ReadonlyDocument error

With this feature flag turned off, a ``ReadonlyDocument`` error will be
raised when destroying or deleting, as well as when saving or updating.

Prior to Mongoid 8.1 and in 8.1 with the ``legacy_readonly`` feature flag 
turned on, documents become read-only when they are projected (i.e. using 
``#only`` or ``#without``).

.. code:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :name, type: String
    field :genre, type: String
  end

  band = Band.only(:name).first
  band.readonly? # => true
  band.destroy # => raises ReadonlyDocument error

Note that with this feature flag on, a ``ReadonlyDocument`` error will only be
raised when destroying or deleting, and not on saving or updating. See the 
section on :ref:`Read-only Documents <readonly-documents>` for more details.
