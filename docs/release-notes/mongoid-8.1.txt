Added ``Mongoid::Criteria`` finder methods
------------------------------------------

Mongoid 8.1 implements several finder methods on ``Mongoid::Criteria``:

- ``first!``
- ``last!``
- ``second/second!``
- ``third/third!``
- ``fourth/fourth!``
- ``fifth/fifth!``
- ``second_to_last/second_to_last!``
- ``third_to_last/third_to_last!``

When no documents are found, methods without a bang (!) return nil, and methods
with a bang (!) raise an error:

.. code:: ruby

  Band.none.first
  # => nil

  Band.none.first!
  # => raise Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound


Added ``:touch`` option to ``#save``
------------------------------------

Support for the ``:touch`` option has been added to the ``#save`` and ``#save!``
methods. When this option is false, the ``updated_at`` field on the saved
document and all of it's embedded documents will not be updated with the
current time. When this option is true or unset, the ``updated_at`` field will
be updated with the current time.

If the document being saved is a new document (i.e. it has not yet been
persisted to the database), then the ``:touch`` option will be ignored, and the
``updated_at`` (and ``created_at``) fields will be updated with the current
time.
