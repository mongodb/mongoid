This page describes significant changes and improvements in Mongoid 8.1.
The complete list of releases is available `on GitHub
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid/releases>`_ and `in JIRA
<https://jira.mongodb.org/projects/MONGOID?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:release-page>`_;
please consult GitHub releases for detailed release notes and JIRA for
the complete list of issues fixed in each release, including bug fixes.


Configuration DSL No Longer Requires an Argument to its Block
-------------------------------------------------------------

It is now possible to use ``Mongoid.configure`` without
providing an argument to its block:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongoid.configure do
    connect_to("mongoid_test")

    # Use config method when assigning variables
    config.preload_models = true

Note that ``configure`` will continue to support a block argument.
The following is equivalent to the above:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongoid.configure do |config|
    config.connect_to("mongoid_test")

    config.preload_models = true


Added ``Mongoid::Criteria`` finder methods
------------------------------------------

Mongoid 8.1 implements several finder methods on ``Mongoid::Criteria``:

- ``first!``
- ``last!``
- ``second/second!``
- ``third/third!``
- ``fourth/fourth!``
- ``fifth/fifth!``
- ``second_to_last/second_to_last!``
- ``third_to_last/third_to_last!``

When no documents are found, methods without a bang (!) return nil, and methods
with a bang (!) raise an error:

.. code:: ruby

  Band.none.first
  # => nil

  Band.none.first!
  # => raise Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound


Added ``:touch`` option to ``#save``
------------------------------------

Support for the ``:touch`` option has been added to the ``#save`` and ``#save!``
methods. When this option is false, the ``updated_at`` field on the saved
document and all of it's embedded documents will not be updated with the
current time. When this option is true or unset, the ``updated_at`` field will
be updated with the current time.

If the document being saved is a new document (i.e. it has not yet been
persisted to the database), then the ``:touch`` option will be ignored, and the
``updated_at`` (and ``created_at``) fields will be updated with the current
time.


Added Version Based Default Configuration
-----------------------------------------

Mongoid 8.1 has added the ability to set the default configurations for a
specific version:

.. code:: ruby

  Mongoid.configure do |config|
    config.load_defaults 8.0
  end

This is helpful for upgrading between versions. See the section on
:ref:`Version Based Default Configuration <load-defaults>` for more details on
how to use this feature to make upgrading between Mongoid versions easier.


Added ``:present`` option to localized fields
---------------------------------------------

The ``:present`` option was added to localized fields for removing blank values
from the ``_translations`` hash:

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Product
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :description, localize: :present
   end

See the section on :ref:`Localize :present Field Option <present-fields>` for
more details on how these are used.
