This page describes significant changes and improvements in Mongoid 9.0.
The complete list of releases is available `on GitHub
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid/releases>`_ and `in JIRA

please consult GitHub releases for detailed release notes and JIRA for
the complete list of issues fixed in each release, including bug fixes.

``touch`` method now clears changed state
-----------------------------------------

In Mongoid 8.x and older ``touch`` method leaves models in the changed state:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Mongoid 8.x behaviour
  band = Band.create!
  band.touch
  band.changed? # => true
  band.changes # => {"updated_at"=>[2023-01-30 13:12:57.477191135 UTC, 2023-01-30 13:13:11.482975646 UTC]}

Starting from 9.0 Mongoid now correctly clears changed state after using ``touch``
method.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Mongoid 9.0 behaviour
  band = Band.create!
  band.touch
  band.changed? # => false
  band.changes # => {}

Sandbox Mode for Rails Console
------------------------------

Mongoid now supports Rails console sandbox mode. If the Rails console started
with ``--sandbox`` flag, Mongoid starts a transaction on the ``:default`` client
before opening the console. This transaction won't be committed; therefore, all
the commands executed in the console using the ``:default`` client won't
be persisted in the database.

.. note::
  If you execute commands in the sandbox mode *using any other client than default*,
  these changes will be persisted as usual.

New Transactions API
--------------------

Mongoid 9.0 introduces new transactions API that is inspired by ActiveRecord:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.transaction do
    Band.create(title: 'Led Zeppelin')
  end

  band = Band.create(title: 'Deep Purple')
  band.transaction do
    band.active = false
    band.save!
  end

Please consult :ref:`transactions documentation <transactions>` for more details.

Embedded Documents Always Use Parent Persistence Context
--------------------------------------------------------

Mongoid 8.x and older allows user to specify persistence context for an
embedded document (using ``store_in`` macro). In Mongoid 9.0 these settings are
ignored for embedded documents; an embedded document now always uses the persistence
context of its parent.


Raise AttributeNotLoaded error when accessing fields omitted from query projection
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When attempting to access a field on a model instance which was
excluded with the ``.only`` or ``.without`` query projections methods
when the instance was loaded, Mongoid will now raise a
``Mongoid::Errors::AttributeNotLoaded`` error.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.only(:name).first.label
  #=> raises Mongoid::Errors::AttributeNotLoaded

  Band.without(:label).first.label = 'Sub Pop Records'
  #=> raises Mongoid::Errors::AttributeNotLoaded

In earlier Mongoid versions, the same conditions would raise an
``ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError``. Please check your code for
any Mongoid-specific usages of this class, and change them to
``Mongoid::Errors::AttributeNotLoaded``. Note additionally that
``AttributeNotLoaded`` inherits from ``Mongoid::Errors::MongoidError``,
while ``ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError`` does not.


Use configured time zone to typecast Date to Time in queries
-------------------------------------------------------------

When querying for a Time field using a Date value, Mongoid now correctly
considers the ``Mongoid.use_activesupport_time_zone`` configuration option
to perform type conversion.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongoid.use_activesupport_time_zone = true

  class Magazine
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :published_at, type: Time
  end

  Time.zone = 'Asia/Tokyo'

  Magazine.gte(published_at: Date.parse('2022-09-26'))
  #=> will return all results on or after Sept 26th, 2022
  #   at 0:00 in Asia/Tokyo time zone.

In prior Mongoid versions, the above code would ignore the
``Mongoid.use_activesupport_time_zone`` setting and behave as if
it were false, i.e. always using the system time zone to perform
the type conversion.

Note that in prior Mongoid versions, typecasting Date to Time during
persistence operations was already correctly using the
``Mongoid.use_activesupport_time_zone`` setting.


```#touch`` method on embedded documents correctly handles ``touch: false`` option
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the ``touch: false`` option is set on an ``embedded_in`` relation,
calling the ``#touch`` method on an embedded child document will not
invoke ``#touch`` on its parent document.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Address
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Mongoid::Timestamps

    embedded_in :mall, touch: false
  end

  class Mall
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Mongoid::Timestamps

    embeds_many :addresses
  end

  mall = Mall.create!
  address = mall.addresses.create!

  address.touch
  #=> updates address.updated_at but not mall.updated_at

In addition, the ``#touch`` method has been optimized to perform one
persistence operation per parent document, even when using multiple
levels of nested embedded documents.


Flipped default for ``:replace`` option in ``#upsert``
------------------------------------------------------

Mongoid 8.1 added the ``:replace`` option to the ``#upsert`` method. This
option was used to specify whether or not the existing document should be
updated or replaced.

Mongoid 9.0 flips the default of this flag from ``true`` => ``false``.

This means that, by default, Mongoid 9 will update the existing document and
will not replace it.


Bug Fixes and Improvements
--------------------------

This section will be for smaller bug fixes and improvements:

- The ``.tally`` method can now take a keyword arg :splat_arrays
  which tallies array values individually (using the ``$unwind`` operator.)
  `MONGOID-5556 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-5556>`_.
- The ``.unscoped`` method now also clears scopes declared using ``.with_scope``
  `MONGOID-5214 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-5214>`_.
- When evolving a ``String`` to a ``BigDecimal`` (i.e. when querying a
  ``BigDecimal`` field with a ``String`` object), if the
  ``map_big_decimal_to_decimal128`` flag set to true, the conversion will
  return a ``BSON::Decimal128`` and not a ``String``
  `MONGOID-5484 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-5484>`_.
- Created new error ``Mongoid::Errors::InvalidEstimatedCountCriteria`` for
  when calling ``estimated_document_count`` on a document class with a
  default scope
  `MONGOID-4960 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-4960>`_.
- Mongoid now uses primary reads for validations in all cases
  `MONGOID-5150 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-5150>`_.
- Added support for symbol keys in localized field translation hashes
  `MONGOID-5334 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-5334>`_.
- Added index wildcard option
  `MONGOID-5388 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-5388>`_.
- With the ``map_big_decimal_to_decimal128`` flag set to false, ``demongoizing``
  a non-numeric, non-string value that implements ``:to_d`` will return a string
  rather than a ``BigDecimal``
  `MONGOID-5507 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-5507>`_.
