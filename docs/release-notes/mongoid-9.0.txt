please consult GitHub releases for detailed release notes and JIRA for
the complete list of issues fixed in each release, including bug fixes.


Raise AttributeNotLoaded error when accessing fields omitted from query projection
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When attempting to access a field on a model instance which was
excluded with the ``.only`` or ``.without`` query projections methods
when the instance was loaded, Mongoid will now raise a
``Mongoid::Errors::AttributeNotLoaded`` error.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.only(:name).first.label
  #=> raises Mongoid::Errors::AttributeNotLoaded

  Band.without(:label).first.label = 'Sub Pop Records'
  #=> raises Mongoid::Errors::AttributeNotLoaded

In earlier Mongoid versions, the same conditions would raise an
``ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError``. Please check your code for
any Mongoid-specific usages of this class, and change them to
``Mongoid::Errors::AttributeNotLoaded``. Note additionally that
``AttributeNotLoaded`` inherits from ``Mongoid::Errors::MongoidError``,
while ``ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError`` does not.


Use configured time zone to typecast Date to Time in queries
-------------------------------------------------------------

When querying for a Time field using a Date value, Mongoid now correctly
considers the ``Mongoid.use_activesupport_time_zone`` configuration option
to perform type conversion.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongoid.use_activesupport_time_zone = true

  class Magazine
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :published_at, type: Time
  end

  Time.zone = 'Asia/Tokyo'

  Magazine.gte(published_at: Date.parse('2022-09-26'))
  #=> will return all results on or after Sept 26th, 2022
  #   at 0:00 in Asia/Tokyo time zone.

In prior Mongoid versions, the above code would ignore the
``Mongoid.use_activesupport_time_zone`` setting and behave as if
it were false, i.e. always using the system time zone to perform
the type conversion.

Note that in prior Mongoid versions, typecasting Date to Time during
persistence operations was already correctly using the
``Mongoid.use_activesupport_time_zone`` setting.


```#touch`` method on embedded documents correctly handles ``touch: false`` option
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the ``touch: false`` option is set on an ``embedded_in`` relation,
calling the ``#touch`` method on an embedded child document will not
invoke ``#touch`` on its parent document.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Address
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Mongoid::Timestamps

    embedded_in :mall, touch: false
  end

  class Mall
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Mongoid::Timestamps

    embeds_many :addresses
  end

  mall = Mall.create!
  address = mall.addresses.create!

  address.touch
  #=> updates address.updated_at but not mall.updated_at

In addition, the ``#touch`` method has been optimized to perform one
persistence operation per parent document, even when using multiple
levels of nested embedded documents.


Flipped default for ``:replace`` option in ``#upsert``
------------------------------------------------------

Mongoid 8.1 added the ``:replace`` option to the ``#upsert`` method. This
option was used to specify whether or not the existing document should be
updated or replaced.

Mongoid 9.0 flips the default of this flag from ``true`` => ``false``.

This means that, by default, Mongoid 9 will update the existing document and
will not replace it.


Bug Fixes and Improvements
--------------------------

This section will be for smaller bug fixes and improvements:

- With the ``map_big_decimal_to_decimal128`` flag set to false, ``demongoizing``
  a non-numeric, non-string value that implements ``:to_d`` will return a string
  rather than a ``BigDecimal``
  `MONGOID-5507 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-5507>`_.
