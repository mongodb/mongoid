This page describes significant changes and improvements in Mongoid 9.0.
The complete list of releases is available `on GitHub
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid/releases>`_ and `in JIRA
<https://jira.mongodb.org/projects/MONGOID?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:release-page>`_;
please consult GitHub releases for detailed release notes and JIRA for
the complete list of issues fixed in each release, including bug fixes.


Deprecated options removed
--------------------------

**Breaking change:** The following config options are removed in Mongoid 9.0.
Please ensure you have removed all references to these from your app.
If you were using ``config.load_defaults 8.1`` prior to upgrading, you will not
experience any behavior change. Refer to earlier release notes for the meaning
of each option.

- ``:use_activesupport_time_zone``
- ``:broken_aggregables``
- ``:broken_alias_handling``
- ``:broken_and``
- ``:broken_scoping``
- ``:broken_updates``
- ``:compare_time_by_ms``
- ``:legacy_attributes``
- ``:legacy_pluck_distinct``
- ``:legacy_triple_equals``
- ``:object_id_as_json_oid``
- ``:overwrite_chained_operators``

In addition, support for ``config.load_defaults`` versions 7.5 and
prior has been dropped (you must use a minimum of version 8.0.)


Deprecated functionality removed
--------------------------------

- The ``Mongoid::QueryCache`` module has been removed. Please replace any usages 1-for-1 with ``Mongo::QueryCache``.
  The method ``Mongoid::QueryCache#clear_cache`` should be replaced with ``Mongo::QueryCache#clear``.
  All other methods and submodules are identically named. Refer to the `driver query cache documentation
  <https://mongodb.com/docs/ruby-driver/current/reference/query-cache/>`_ for more details.


``touch`` method now clears changed state
-----------------------------------------

In Mongoid 8.x and older ``touch`` method leaves models in the changed state:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Mongoid 8.x behaviour
  band = Band.create!
  band.touch
  band.changed? # => true
  band.changes # => {"updated_at"=>[2023-01-30 13:12:57.477191135 UTC, 2023-01-30 13:13:11.482975646 UTC]}

Starting from 9.0 Mongoid now correctly clears changed state after using ``touch``
method.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Mongoid 9.0 behaviour
  band = Band.create!
  band.touch
  band.changed? # => false
  band.changes # => {}

Sandbox Mode for Rails Console
------------------------------

Mongoid now supports Rails console sandbox mode. If the Rails console started
with ``--sandbox`` flag, Mongoid starts a transaction on the ``:default`` client
before opening the console. This transaction won't be committed; therefore, all
the commands executed in the console using the ``:default`` client won't
be persisted in the database.

.. note::
  If you execute commands in the sandbox mode *using any other client than default*,
  these changes will be persisted as usual.

New Transactions API
--------------------

Mongoid 9.0 introduces new transactions API that is inspired by ActiveRecord:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.transaction do
    Band.create(title: 'Led Zeppelin')
  end

  band = Band.create(title: 'Deep Purple')
  band.transaction do
    band.active = false
    band.save!
  end

Please consult :ref:`transactions documentation <transactions>` for more details.

Embedded Documents Always Use Parent Persistence Context
--------------------------------------------------------

Mongoid 8.x and older allows user to specify persistence context for an
embedded document (using ``store_in`` macro). In Mongoid 9.0 these settings are
ignored for embedded documents; an embedded document now always uses the persistence
context of its parent.


Support for Passing Raw Values into Queries
-------------------------------------------

When performing queries, it is now possible skip Mongoid's type coercion logic
using the ``Mongoid::RawValue`` wrapper class. This can be useful when legacy
data in the database is of a different type than the field definition.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     field :age, type: Integer
   end

   # Query for the string "42", not the integer 42
   Person.where(age: Mongoid::RawValue("42"))


Raise AttributeNotLoaded error when accessing fields omitted from query projection
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When attempting to access a field on a model instance which was
excluded with the ``.only`` or ``.without`` query projections methods
when the instance was loaded, Mongoid will now raise a
``Mongoid::Errors::AttributeNotLoaded`` error.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.only(:name).first.label
  #=> raises Mongoid::Errors::AttributeNotLoaded

  Band.without(:label).first.label = 'Sub Pop Records'
  #=> raises Mongoid::Errors::AttributeNotLoaded

In earlier Mongoid versions, the same conditions would raise an
``ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError``. Please check your code for
any Mongoid-specific usages of this class, and change them to
``Mongoid::Errors::AttributeNotLoaded``. Note additionally that
``AttributeNotLoaded`` inherits from ``Mongoid::Errors::MongoidError``,
while ``ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError`` does not.


Use configured time zone to typecast Date to Time in queries
-------------------------------------------------------------

When querying for a Time field using a Date value, Mongoid now correctly
considers ``Time.zone`` to perform type conversion.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Magazine
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :published_at, type: Time
  end

  Time.zone = 'Asia/Tokyo'

  Magazine.gte(published_at: Date.parse('2022-09-26'))
  #=> will return all results on or after Sept 26th, 2022
  #   at 0:00 in Asia/Tokyo time zone.

In prior Mongoid versions, the above code would ignore the ``Time.zone``
(irrespective of the now-removed ``:use_activesupport_time_zone``
setting) and always using the system time zone to perform the type conversion.

Note that in prior Mongoid versions, typecasting Date to Time during
persistence operations was already correctly using time zone.


```#touch`` method on embedded documents correctly handles ``touch: false`` option
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the ``touch: false`` option is set on an ``embedded_in`` relation,
calling the ``#touch`` method on an embedded child document will not
invoke ``#touch`` on its parent document.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Address
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Mongoid::Timestamps

    embedded_in :mall, touch: false
  end

  class Mall
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Mongoid::Timestamps

    embeds_many :addresses
  end

  mall = Mall.create!
  address = mall.addresses.create!

  address.touch
  #=> updates address.updated_at but not mall.updated_at

In addition, the ``#touch`` method has been optimized to perform one
persistence operation per parent document, even when using multiple
levels of nested embedded documents.


``embedded_in`` associations now default to ``touch: true``
-----------------------------------------------------------

Updating an embedded subdocument will now automatically touch the parent,
unless you explicitly set ``touch: false`` on the relation:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Address
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Mongoid::Timestamps

    embedded_in :mall, touch: false
  end

For all other associations, the default remains ``touch: false``.


Flipped default for ``:replace`` option in ``#upsert``
------------------------------------------------------

Mongoid 8.1 added the ``:replace`` option to the ``#upsert`` method. This
option was used to specify whether or not the existing document should be
updated or replaced.

Mongoid 9.0 flips the default of this flag from ``true`` => ``false``.

This means that, by default, Mongoid 9 will update the existing document and
will not replace it.


The immutability of the ``_id`` field is now enforced
-----------------------------------------------------

Prior to Mongoid 9.0, mutating the ``_id`` field behaved inconsistently
depending on whether the document was top-level or embedded, and depending on
how the update was performed. As of 9.0, changing the ``_id`` field will now
raise an exception when the document is saved, if the document had been
previously persisted.

Mongoid 9.0 also introduces a new feature flag, ``immutable_ids``, which
defaults to ``true``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongoid::Config.immutable_ids = true

When set to false, the older, inconsistent behavior is restored.


Support Field Aliases on Index Options
--------------------------------------

Support has been added to use aliased field names in the following options
of the ``index`` macro: ``partial_filter_expression``, ``weights``,
``wildcard_projection``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document
    field :a, as: :age
    index({ age: 1 }, { partial_filter_expression: { age: { '$gte' => 20 } })
  end

.. note::

  The expansion of field name aliases in index options such as
  ``partial_filter_expression`` is performed according to the behavior of MongoDB
  server 6.0. Future server versions may change how they interpret these options,
  and Mongoid's functionality may not support such changes.


BSON 5 and BSON::Decimal128 Fields
----------------------------------

When BSON 4 or earlier is present, any field declared as BSON::Decimal128 will
return a BSON::Decimal128 value. When BSON 5 is present, however, any field
declared as BSON::Decimal128 will return a BigDecimal value by default.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Model
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :decimal_field, type: BSON::Decimal128
  end

  # under BSON <= 4
  Model.first.decimal_field.class #=> BSON::Decimal128

  # under BSON >= 5
  Model.first.decimal_field.class #=> BigDecimal

If you need literal BSON::Decimal128 values with BSON 5, you may instruct
Mongoid to allow literal BSON::Decimal128 fields:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Model.first.decimal_field.class #=> BigDecimal

  Mongoid.allow_bson5_decimal128 = true
  Model.first.decimal_field.class #=> BSON::Decimal128

.. note::

  The ``allow_bson5_decimal128`` option only has any effect under
  BSON 5 and later. BSON 4 and earlier ignore the setting entirely.


Bug Fixes and Improvements
--------------------------

This section will be for smaller bug fixes and improvements:

- The ``.unscoped`` method now also clears scopes declared using ``.with_scope``
  `MONGOID-5214 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-5214>`_.
- When evolving a ``String`` to a ``BigDecimal`` (i.e. when querying a
  ``BigDecimal`` field with a ``String`` object), if the
  ``map_big_decimal_to_decimal128`` flag set to true, the conversion will
  return a ``BSON::Decimal128`` and not a ``String``
  `MONGOID-5484 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-5484>`_.
- Created new error ``Mongoid::Errors::InvalidEstimatedCountCriteria`` for
  when calling ``estimated_document_count`` on a document class with a
  default scope
  `MONGOID-4960 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-4960>`_.
- Mongoid now uses primary reads for validations in all cases
  `MONGOID-5150 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-5150>`_.
- Added support for symbol keys in localized field translation hashes
  `MONGOID-5334 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-5334>`_.
- Added index wildcard option
  `MONGOID-5388 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-5388>`_.
- With the ``map_big_decimal_to_decimal128`` flag set to false, ``demongoizing``
  a non-numeric, non-string value that implements ``:to_d`` will return a string
  rather than a ``BigDecimal``
  `MONGOID-5507 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-5507>`_.
- Added support for serializing and deserializing BSON::ObjectId values
  when passed as ActiveJob arguments
  `MONGOID-5611 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-5611>`_.
