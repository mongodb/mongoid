``Document#to_a`` deprecated
````````````````````````````

The ``Document#to_a`` method is deprecated in Mongoid 7.5.


Combine Chained Operators Using ``and`` Instead of ``override``
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Mongoid 7.5 with the ``Mongoid.overwrite_chained_operators`` option set to ``false``
will combine conditions that use the same operator and field using an ``and``.
For example, in the following query:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.ne(name: "The Rolling Stones").ne(name: "The Beatles")

Mongoid 7.5 with the ``Mongoid.overwrite_chained_operators`` option set to ``false``
will generate the following criteria:

.. code-block:: ruby

  #<Mongoid::Criteria
    selector: {"name"=>{"$ne"=>"The Rolling Stones"}, "$and"=>[{"name"=>{"$ne"=>"The Beatles"}}]}
    options:  {}
    class:    Band
    embedded: false>

In Mongoid 7.4 and earlier, and in 7.5 with the ``Mongoid.overwrite_chained_operators``
option set to ``true``, the following criteria would be generated instead which
overwrites the first condition:

.. code-block:: ruby

  #<Mongoid::Criteria
    selector: {"name"=>{"$ne"=>"The Beatles"}}
    options:  {}
    class:    Band
    embedded: false>

The following functions are affected by this change:

- ``eq``
- ``elem_match``
- ``gt``
- ``gte``
- ``lt``
- ``lte``
- ``mod``
- ``ne``
- ``near``
- ``near_sphere``

.. note::

   In Mongoid 7.5 with the ``Mongoid.overwrite_chained_operators`` option set to
   ``false``, nested keys in the generated selector will always be strings,
   whereas in Mongoid 7.4 and earlier, and in 7.5 with the
   ``Mongoid.overwrite_chained_operators`` option set to ``true``, nested keys in
   the selector can be strings or symbols, depending on what was passed to the
   operator.
