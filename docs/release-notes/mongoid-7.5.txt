This page describes significant changes and improvements in Mongoid 7.5.
The complete list of releases is available `on GitHub
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid/releases>`_ and `in JIRA
<https://jira.mongodb.org/projects/MONGOID?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:release-page>`_;
please consult GitHub releases for detailed release notes and JIRA for
the complete list of issues fixed in each release, including bug fixes.


Ruby, JRuby and Rails Version Support
-------------------------------------

Mongoid 7.5 deprecates support for Ruby 2.5, JRuby 9.2 and Rails 5.1.
Mongoid 8 will require Ruby 2.6 or newer, JRuby 9.3 or newer and Rails 5.2 or
newer.


Feature Flags Summary
---------------------

To ensure a stable upgrade path from Mongoid 7.4, Mongoid 7.5
introduces feature flags which are further explained in the
sections below.

To enable all new behavior in Mongoid 7.5, please use the following
:ref:`configuration options <configuration-options>` in your mongoid.yml file.
We recommend newly created apps to do this as well.

.. code-block:: yaml

  development:
    ...
    options:
      # Enable all new behavior in Mongoid 7.5
      legacy_attributes: false
      overwrite_chained_operators: false

In addition, please refer to the release notes of earlier 7.x versions for
feature flags introduced in each version. For clarity, Mongoid 7.5 does
not switch the behavior of any previously introduced feature flag.


Implemented ``Criteria#take/take!`` Method
------------------------------------------

Mongoid 7.5 introduces the ``#take`` method which returns a document
or a set of documents from the database without ordering by ``_id``:

.. code:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document
  end

  Band.create!
  Band.create!

  Band.take
  # => #<Band _id: 62c835813282a4470c07d530, >
  Band.take(2)
  # => [ #<Band _id: 62c835813282a4470c07d530, >, #<Band _id: 62c835823282a4470c07d531, > ]

If a parameter is given to ``#take``, an array of documents is returned. If no parameter is
given, a singular document is returned.

The ``#take!`` method functions the same as calling ``#take`` without arguments,
but raises an DocumentNotFound error instead of returning nil if no documents
are found.

.. code:: ruby

  Band.take!
  # => #<Band _id: 62c835813282a4470c07d530, >

Note that the ``#take/take!`` methods do not apply a sort to the view before
retrieving the documents from the database, and therefore they may return different
results than the ``#first`` and ``#last`` methods. ``#take`` is equivalent to
calling ``#first`` or ``#last`` with the ``{ id_sort: :none }`` option. This
option has been deprecated in Mongoid 7.5 and it is recommended to use ``#take``
instead going forward. Support for the ``:id_sort`` option will be dropped in
Mongoid 8.


Force the ``attributes`` Method to Always Return a ``Hash``
-----------------------------------------------------------

Mongoid 7.5 with the ``Mongoid.legacy_attributes`` option set to ``false``
will always return a ``Hash`` when calling the ``attributes`` method.
For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Band
    include Mongoid::Document

    field :name
  end

  band = Band.create!(name: "The Rolling Stones")
  p band.attributes.class
  # => Hash

  band = Band.first
  p band.attributes.class
  # => Hash

In Mongoid 7.4 and earlier, and in 7.5 with the ``Mongoid.legacy_attributes``
option set to ``true``, the ``attributes`` method on a document will return a
``BSON::Document`` when retrieving that document from the database, but will
return a ``Hash`` when instantiating a new document:

.. code-block:: ruby

  band = Band.create!(name: "The Rolling Stones")
  p band.attributes.class
  # => Hash

  band = Band.first
  p band.attributes.class
  # => BSON::Document


Deprecate ``:id_sort`` Option and Support ``limit`` on ``#first/last``
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mongoid 7.5 deprecates the ``:id_sort`` keyword argument for the
``Criteria#first`` and ``Criteria#last`` methods. Please use ``Criteria#take``
to retrieve documents without sorting by id.

The ``first`` and ``last`` methods now take the number of documents to return
as a positional argument, mirroring the functionality of Ruby's ``Enumerable``
method and ActiveRecord's ``first`` and ``last`` methods. Both invocations
(with limit as a positional arguments and with the ``:id_sort`` option) remain
supported in Mongoid 7.x, but the ``:id_sort`` invocation will be removed in
Mongoid 8.

.. code:: ruby

  Band.first
  # => #<Band _id: 62c835813282a4470c07d530, >
  Band.first(2)
  # => [ #<Band _id: 62c835813282a4470c07d530, >, #<Band _id: 62c835823282a4470c07d531, > ]
  Band.last
  # => #<Band _id: 62c835823282a4470c07d531, >
  Band.last(2)
  # => [#<Band _id: 62c835813282a4470c07d530, >, #<Band _id: 62c835823282a4470c07d531, >]

When providing a limit, ``#first/last`` will return a list of documents, and
when not providing a limit (or providing ``nil``), a single document will be
returned.

Note that the ``#first/last`` methods apply a sort on ``_id``, which can
cause performance issues. To get a document without sorting first, use the
``Critera#take`` method.


Combine Chained Operators Using ``and`` Instead of ``override``
---------------------------------------------------------------

Mongoid 7.5 with the ``Mongoid.overwrite_chained_operators`` option set to ``false``
will combine conditions that use the same operator and field using an ``and``.
For example, in the following query:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.ne(name: "The Rolling Stones").ne(name: "The Beatles")

Mongoid 7.5 with the ``Mongoid.overwrite_chained_operators`` option set to ``false``
will generate the following criteria:

.. code-block:: ruby

  #<Mongoid::Criteria
    selector: {"name"=>{"$ne"=>"The Rolling Stones"}, "$and"=>[{"name"=>{"$ne"=>"The Beatles"}}]}
    options:  {}
    class:    Band
    embedded: false>

In Mongoid 7.4 and earlier, and in 7.5 with the ``Mongoid.overwrite_chained_operators``
option set to ``true``, the following criteria would be generated instead which
overwrites the first condition:

.. code-block:: ruby

  #<Mongoid::Criteria
    selector: {"name"=>{"$ne"=>"The Beatles"}}
    options:  {}
    class:    Band
    embedded: false>

The following functions are affected by this change:

- ``eq``
- ``elem_match``
- ``gt``
- ``gte``
- ``lt``
- ``lte``
- ``mod``
- ``ne``
- ``near``
- ``near_sphere``

.. note::

   In Mongoid 7.5 with the ``Mongoid.overwrite_chained_operators`` option set to
   ``false``, nested keys in the generated selector will always be strings,
   whereas in Mongoid 7.4 and earlier, and in 7.5 with the
   ``Mongoid.overwrite_chained_operators`` option set to ``true``, nested keys in
   the selector can be strings or symbols, depending on what was passed to the
   operator.


``pluck`` Usage of ``map`` Deprecated
-------------------------------------

Mongoid 7.5 deprecates the usage of ``map`` as pluck, as in the following
example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Band.all.map(:name)
  
  # Equivalent to:
  Band.pluck(:name)

This usage will no longer be supported in Mongoid 8, which will not accept
arguments to ``map``.


``Mongoid::Criteria`` cache deprecated
--------------------------------------

The ability to cache individual criteria objects has been deprecated in Mongoid
7.5 and will be dropped in Mongoid 8.

In order to get caching functionality, enable the Mongoid QueryCache. See the
section on :ref:`QueryCache <query-cache>` for more details.


``Array#update_values`` and ``Hash#update_values`` deprecated
-------------------------------------------------------------

The ``Array#update_values`` and ``Hash#update_values`` methods are deprecated in
Mongoid 7.5. It is recommended to use ActiveSupport's ``transform_values!``
method instead.


``Document#to_a`` deprecated
----------------------------

The ``Document#to_a`` method is deprecated in Mongoid 7.5.


``update_one`` Warnings in ``upsert``
-------------------------------------

Mongoid 7.5 fixes incorrect usage of the driver's ``update_one`` method from
Mongoid's ``upsert`` method. Mongoid's ``upsert`` actually performs a
replacing upsert, and Mongoid 7.5 correctly calls ``replace_one``.
