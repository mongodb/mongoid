``set`` Overwrites Complete Document
------------------------------------

**Breaking change:** In Mongoid 7.0.2 and higher, ``set`` fully overwrites
the targeted attributes in the database, including any nested documents
and nested attributes. This behavior matches that of MongoDB ``$set`` operator.
In Mongoid 7.0.1 and lower, ``set`` retained other attributes present in the
database below the document being written:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Product
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    field :tags, type: Hash
  end
  
  product = Product.new(tags: {color: 'black'})
  product.set(tags: {size: 'large'})
  
  product
  # Mongoid 7.0.2+:
  # => #<Product _id: 62ab9770ce4ef31ac572679c, tags: {:size=>"large"}>
  #
  # Mongoid 7.0.1:
  # => #<Product _id: 62ab9770ce4ef31ac572679c, tags: {:color=>"black", :size=>"large"}>
