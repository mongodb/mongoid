<https://jira.mongodb.org/projects/MONGOID?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:release-page>`_;

Please note that improvements that have been backported to Mongoid 6.x are
not included in this list.

The behavior of :ref:`read-only attributes <read-only>` now matches that of
ActiveRecord.

Referenced associations now support all :ref:`dependent behaviors <dependent-behavior>`
that `ActiveRecord supports <http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html>`_.

:ref:`$unwind <unwind-dsl>` operator support added to the :ref:`aggregation
pipeline builder DSL <aggregation-pipeline-builder-dsl>`.

``background_indexing`` Mongoid :ref:`configuration option
<configuration-options>` added.

Mongoid 7.0 requires MongoDB server 2.6 or newer, Ruby 2.2.2 or higher and
supports Rails 5.1-6.0.

New in version 7.0.3: Embedded matchers now support the ``$eq`` operator.

New in version 7.0.5: Mongoid now officially supports Rails 6.0.


``set`` Overwrites Complete Document
------------------------------------

**Breaking change:** In Mongoid 7.0.2 and higher, ``set`` writes
the provided attributes as the complete document (or sub-document), replacing
any other attributes stored in the database. This behavior matches that of
MongoDB ``$set`` operator. In Mongoid 7.0.1 and lower, ``set`` retained other
attributes present in the database below the document being written:

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Product
    include Mongoid::Document
    
    field :tags, type: Hash
  end
  
  product = Product.new(tags: {color: 'black'})
  product.set(tags: {size: 'large'})
  
  product
  # Mongoid 7.0.2+:
  # => #<Product _id: 62ab9770ce4ef31ac572679c, tags: {:size=>"large"}>
  #
  # Mongoid 7.0.1:
  # => #<Product _id: 62ab9770ce4ef31ac572679c, tags: {:color=>"black", :size=>"large"}>
