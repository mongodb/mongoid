          message: "Calling %{method} on %{klass} resulted in a false return
            from a callback."
          summary: "If a before callback returns false when using Document.create!,
            Document#save!, or Documnet#update_attributes! this error will get raised
            since the document did not actually get saved."
          resolution: "Double check all before callbacks to make sure they are
            not unintentionally returning false."
        calling_document_find_with_nil_is_invalid:
          message: "Calling Document.find with nil is invalid."
          summary: "Document.find expects the parameters to be 1 or more ids, and
            will return a single document if 1 id is provided, otherwise an array
            of documents if multiple ids are provided."
          resolution: "Most likely this is caused by passing parameters directly
            through to the find, and the parameter either is not present or the
            key from which it is accessed is incorrect."
        document_not_found:
          message: "Document not found for class %{klass} with id(s) %{identifiers}."
          summary: "When calling %{klass}.find with an id or array of ids, each
            parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised."
          resolution: "Search for an id that is in the database or set
            the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false,
            which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error."
        document_with_attributes_not_found:
          message: "Document not found for class %{klass} with attributes %{attributes}."
          summary: "When calling %{klass}.find_by with a hash of attributes, all
            attributes provided must match a document in the database of this error
            will be raised."

            the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false,
            which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error."
        eager_load:
          message: "Eager loading :%{name} is not supported since it is a
            polymorphic belongs_to relation."
          summary: "Mongoid cannot currently determine the classes it needs to
            eager load when the relation is polymorphic. The parents reside in
            different collections so a simple id lookup is not sufficient enough."
          resolution: "Don't attempt to perform this action and have patience,
            maybe this will be supported in the future."
        invalid_collection:
          message: "Access to the collection for %{klass} is not allowed."
          summary: "%{klass}.collection was called, and %{klass} is an embedded
            document - it resides within the collection of the root document of
            the hierarchy."
          resolution: "For access to the collection that the embedded document is
            in, use %{klass}#_root.collection, or do not attempt to persist an
            embedded document without a parent set."
        invalid_database:
          message: "Database should be a Mongo::DB, not %{name}."
          summary: "When setting a master database in the Mongoid configuration
            it must be an actual instance of a Mongo::DB, and not just a name
            of the database. This check is performed when calling
            Mongoid.master = object."
          resolution: "Make sure that when setting the configuration
            programatically that you are passing an actual db instance."
        invalid_field:
          message: "Defining a field named %{name} is not allowed."
          summary: "Defining fields that conflict with Mongoid internal
            attributes or method names is not allowed since it can cause issues
            which are very difficult to track down."
          resolution: "Use Mongoid.destructive_fields to see what names are not
            allowed, and don't use these names. Also defining field names that
            conflict with core Ruby methods on Object, Kernel, or Enumerable is
            a disaster waiting to happen."
        invalid_options:
          message: "Invalid option :%{invalid} provided to relation :%{name}."
          summary: "Mongoid checks the options that are passed to the relation
            macros to ensure that no ill side effects occur by letting something
            slip by."
          resolution: "Valid options are: %{valid}, make sure these are the ones
            you are using."

          summary: "Mongoid tries to serialize the values for Date, DateTime, and
            Time into proper UTC times to store in the database. The provided
            value could not be parsed."
          resolution: "Make sure to pass parsable values to the field setter
            for Date, DateTime, and Time objects. When this is a String it needs
            to be valid for Time.parse. Other objects must be valid to pass to
            Time.local."
        invalid_type:
          message: "Field was defined as a(n) %{klass}, but received a %{other}
            with the value %{value}."
          summary: "Some types in Mongoid prevent you from setting them to a
            value that differs from the defined type, like Array, instead of
            attempting to convert it."
          resolution: "Set the proper type, %{klass}."
        inverse_not_found:
          message: "When adding a(n) %{klass} to %{base}#%{name}, Mongoid could
            not determine the inverse foreign key to set. The attempted key was
            '%{inverse}'."
          summary: "When adding a document to a relation, Mongoid attempts
            to link the newly added document to the base of the relation in
            memory, as well as set the foreign key to link them on the
            database side. In this case Mongoid could not determine what the
            inverse foreign key was."
          resolution: "If an inverse is not required, like a belongs_to or
            has_and_belongs_to_many, ensure that :inverse_of => nil is set
            on the relation. If the inverse is needed, most likely the
            inverse cannot be figured out from the names of the relations and
            you will need to explicitly tell Mongoid on the relation what
            the inverse is.\n

          summary: "In order to properly access a(n) %{embedded} from %{root}
            the reference would need to go through the root document of
            %{embedded}. In a simple case this would require Mongoid to store
            an extra foreign key for the root, in more complex cases where
            %{embedded} is multiple levels deep a key would need to be stored

            to call %{klass}#%{name}= for it is not allowed. This is also
            triggered by passing the attribute to any method that accepts an
