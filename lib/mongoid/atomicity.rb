  module Atomicity
    extend ActiveSupport::Concern

    # Get all the atomic updates that need to happen for the current
    # +Document+. This includes all changes that need to happen in the
    # entire hierarchy that exists below where the save call was made.
    #
    # @note
    #   MongoDB does not allow "conflicting modifications" to be
    #   performed in a single operation.  Conflicting modifications are
    #   detected by the 'haveConflictingMod' function in MongoDB.
    #   Examination of the code suggests that two modifications (a $set
    #   and a $pushAll, for example) conflict if:
    #     (1) the key paths being modified are equal.
    #     (2) one key path is a prefix of the other.
    #   So a $set of 'addresses.0.street' will conflict with a $pushAll
    #   to 'addresses', and we will need to split our update into two
    #   pieces.  We do not, however, attempt to match MongoDB's logic
    #   exactly.  Instead, we assume that two updates conflict if the
    #   first component of the two key paths matches.
    #
    # @example Get the updates that need to occur.
    #   person._updates
    #
    # @return [ Hash ] The updates and their modifiers.
