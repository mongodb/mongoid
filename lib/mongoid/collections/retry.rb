    # Provides behaviour for retrying commands on connection failure.
    module Retry

      # Retries command on connection failures.
      #
      # This is useful when using replica sets. When a primary server wents
      # down and a command is issued, the driver will raise a
      # Mongo::ConnectionFailure. We wait a little bit, because nodes are
      # electing themselves, and then retry the given command.
      #
      # By setting Mongoid.max_retries_on_connection_failure to a value of 0,
      # no attempt will be made, immediately raising connection failure.
      # Otherwise it will attempt to make the specified number of retries
      # and then raising the exception to clients.
      #
      # @example Retry the command.
      #   retry_on_connection_failure do
      #     collection.send(name, *args)
      #   end
      #
