      # determined. Note that persistence from the embedded documents will
      # always be preferred, since they are optimized calls... This operation
      # can get expensive in domains with large hierarchies.

      # Example:
      #
      # <tt>person._children</tt>

      # All child +Documents+ to this +Document+ in the entire hierarchy.
