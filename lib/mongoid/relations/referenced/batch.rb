        # intercept all database inserts while in this block and combine them
        # into a single database call. When the block concludes the batch
        # insert will occur.

        # Since the collection is accessed through the class it would not be
        # thread safe to give it state so we access the atomic updater via the
        # current thread.
        #
        # @note This operation is not safe when attemping to do illegal updates
        #   for different objects or collections, since the updator is not
        #   scoped on the thread. This is meant for Mongoid internal use only
        #   to keep existing design clean.
        #
        # @example Batch update multiple appends.
