      # Update is a persistence command responsible for taking a document that
      # has already been saved to the database and saving it, depending on
      # whether or not the document has been modified.
      #
      # Before persisting the command will check via dirty attributes if the
      # document has changed, if not, it will simply return true. If it has it
      # will go through the validation steps, run callbacks, and set the changed
      # fields atomically on the document. The underlying query resembles the
      # following MongoDB query:
      #
      #   collection.update(
      #     { "_id" : 1,
      #     { "$set" : { "field" : "value" },
      #     false,
      #     false
      #   );
      #
      # For embedded documents it will use the positional locator:
      #
      #   collection.update(
      #     { "_id" : 1, "addresses._id" : 2 },
      #     { "$set" : { "addresses.$.field" : "value" },
      #     false,
      #     false
      #   );
