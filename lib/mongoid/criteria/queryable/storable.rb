        # separately for callers' convenience. It can be considered to
        # handle storing the hash +{operator => op_expr}+.

        # If the selector consists of a single condition which is the specified
        # operator (on the top level), the new condition given in op_expr is

        # straightforward for $and; for other logical operators, the behavior
        # of this method is to add the new conditions to the existing operator.
